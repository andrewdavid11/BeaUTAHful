	  <h1>Licensing and Contracts</h1>

		   <p>If you are interested in using my photography for any reason, that sounds great to me. I do not have 
		   much experience working out licensing agreements, but I am sure we can create an agreement good for both sides. I would love to see 
		   my work in magazines, calendars, online, or in your gallery or gift shop.<br />
		   I enter photo contests frequently and am contacting local galleries in search of wall space. There are more
		   opportunities than I can actively seek however, and don't hesitate to make first <a href="contact.php">contact</a> with me. 
		   </p>
		   <p>I am willing to consider consignment contracts with gift shops and book shops, though I prefer to sell outright.<br />
		   Stores looking for larger quantities than on offer through this site (for cards and posters specifically) can <a href="contact.php">contact me</a>.
		   Re-orders will be easy and quick, and I will be adding an ordering page specifically taylored to gift shops in the near future.</p>
	  <h2>Prints and Gift Options</h2>
	       <img src="Pictures/WallPrintsB.jpg" />
		   <p>I am offering a variety of print sizes and media on this site with an easy shopping cart check out.<br />
		   There are a wide range of sizes in paper prints, canvas, and metal. I also offer all my photos on 5" X 7" flip cards and in collage posters.</p>
		   <p>These flip cards cost only a few dollars each and can be sent by mail with a standard stamp. Hundreds of cards can be displayed in a minimum of space making them a good choice for shops, 
		   countertops, and check out areas. My flip cards also look good enough to frame and hang. My posters are rolled in plastic sleeves and are another good option for gift shops.
		   I offer several themes and series of collage posters on this site, but custom orders are accepted as well. Bulk discounts for cards and posters are available. Easy 
		   ordering can be done through the site </p>
		   <img src="Pictures/CardFramed.jpg" />
		   <p>Paper prints are my most cost-effective lineup of larger options, but do require frames to protect the print. Canvas prints can be framed. Metal prints typically are not.<br />
		   Which of these are best depends on personal preference, the photo in question, and probably the room and wall you intend to use.<br />
		   I am happy to offer suggestions and guidance, if you want it. Just <a href="contact.php">contact me</a> with your questions.</p>
		   <p>Personally, I like a mix of sizes, orientations, and media on my own walls.</p>
		   <p>There is some more info about print options on the ordering pages. To get there just go through the galleries or start at the search page.<br />
		   If you see a photo you like, then click it or tap it and you will see it larger on the order page. All your options for sizes and styles will be under the image.</p>
		   <p>I tried to make things simple, but with over 500 photos on the site, and many options for each picture, feel free to <a href="contact.php">contact me</a> any time with questions or comments, or just to talk shop.</p>
