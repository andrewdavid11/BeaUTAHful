1/ WheelerRamp.jpg/ Mount Wheeler in Winter/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ Hiking up 13,000+ ft Mount Wheeler is a special treat in winter, when dry desert expanses stretch below sparkling snow underfoot. One of the West's easiest 13,000 ft peaks, with a fine campground and road above 10,000 ft./ P/ winter 
2/ WheelerSummit.jpg/ Mount Wheeler Summit View/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ This magnificent view of shining Pyramid Peak and other mountains came on a brisk November afternoon. The snow melted out by the next day when I hiked out to Pyramid Peak, but the night was very cold in my tent/  near 0./ L/ summit, winter , desert
3/ ValleyFireSunset.jpg/ World on Fire/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ Rocks of every color flare up as the sun falls on a hike through wild ancient forms. There are many wonderful short trails in this park. Don't miss the morning or evening when there./ L/ desert, sunset 
4/ ValleyFireStripeRock.jpg/ Red Band of Lava/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ One can only guess at the swirls of magma and the heat necessary to produce this singular formation. Discovered this wondering the slickrock in search of a famous “Tiger Wave”./ L/ desert, rock 
5/ BearGrassSparkle.jpg/ Beargrass Wink/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Beargrass blossoms can be finicky and unpredictable, but you are sure to spot some on your travels in Glacier Park. Shout out to alert any grizzlies feasting near big collections./ P/ flower 
6/ HelenSummit1.jpg/ Mount Helen Summit View 1/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A long but easy walk offers great panoramas in every direction near Dawson's Pass, common home to many goats. I met a whole herd on this day, and a few playful youngsters on the famous Dawson Pass goat trail nearby./ L/ summit 
7/ HelenSummit2.jpg/ Mount Helen Summit View 2/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ The feeling one is on top of the world is a common one at Glacier. Here, Mt St Nicholas and other jagged peaks tower over a rugged valley very few ever explore. The summit I was on is an easy walk from the Two Medicine section of GNP./ L/ summit 
8/ GNP2Lakes.jpg/ Layers of Lakes/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ The color of lakes fed by glaciers can change drastically day to day and even hour to hour and lakes sitting near to each other may look nothing alike. I enjoy views at Glacier especially when there are “levels” of lakes, often flowing into one another./ L/ lake 
9/ WaterCanyon1.jpg/ Water Canyon Beehives/ Zion National Park, Utah/ Water Canyon sits just outside of Zion National Park officially, but shares many features with more famous canyons, and no red-tape. The dirt road access can be a struggle however./ L/ canyon 
10/ WaterCanyonAction.jpg/ People in Water Canyon/ Zion National Park, Utah/ Friends measure a rappel and check an established anchor before pulling out their ropes to drop over 80 feet./ L/ canyon 
11/ EscalanteVista.jpg/ Distant Desert Mountains/ Escalante, Utah/ This view is one of the highlights of the famous Hwy 12 through Utah's Escalante region. If this view does not inspire you to want to explore the vast area, then nothing will./ L/ desert 
12/ HellRoaringSunrise.jpg/ Sunrise on Hell Roaring Lake/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ Waking up, some friends and I could barely feel our fingers on a frosty bitter morning, but the view was gorgeous as we stretched. We spent the rest of a warm day hiking and climbing and got back just in time for a rushed meal and a similar view at sunset./ L/ sunrise, reflection 
13/ Grouse1.jpg/ Grouse Posing/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ This content mountain grouse posed and preened without much fear as I hiked past. Lucky for her I wasn't a hunter. But we met a few hunters minutes later heading her way./ L/ wildlife 
14/ PriodLake1.jpg/ Priod Lake From Above/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ This stunning silent lake is surrounded by rugged cliffs, many miles from the nearest trail, and very rarely visited. Not sure about the fishing as it is above 9,000 feet, but we were thankful to catch some fresh cold water on our way up and again on the way out./ L/ 
15/ FingerofFateSunrise.jpg/ Finger of Fate in Morning/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ The aptly-named Finger of Fate peak is popular with climbers taking the proper gear and care. The view is worth the hike alone, though. Just to reach these high lakes requires 4+ miles though, the last being quite steep and rugged!/ L/ 
16/ Sundance1.jpg/ Sundance Sunrise/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ They call it Sundance for a reason! A cold morning with fresh powder greeted me on skis, then snowshoes. I did not get far though as I sunk up to my knees and the travel was exhausting!/ P/ 
17/ AliceLake1.jpg/ Alice Lake Reflected/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ A fine skyline of peaks loom reflected behind Alice Lake on a brilliant morning. Fresh prints clustered all around my tent from animal visitors. The lesson is to not keep food in your tent, one I already knew. But loud snuffling during the night made me dream of bears I did not want to meet too badly!/ L/ reflection, lake 
18/ SnowySideSummit1.jpg/ Twin Lakes From Above/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ The hike up Mount Snowyside offers sterling vistas in all directions, including the still and shocking blue Twin Lakes, a fine spot to camp during a popular loop hike./ L/ lake, summit 
19/ FrozenLakesSawtooths.jpg/ Slow Spring Thaw/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ These amazing lakes are late to thaw, sheltered on all sides by the rugged peaks near Mount Snowyside. This was my first ever summit view of iceberg-filled lakes and I could not have been more pleased./ L/ lake, winter, summit 
20/ AlpenLake1.jpg/ Alpen Lake Reflected/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ Popular Alpen Lake may have seen better days due to overuse, but no one will complain about the reflections when the water is still. The location is perfect for a night of camping, though pine beetles have left the trees sick and ragged./ L/ reflection, lake 
21/ LavaMound.jpg/ Lava Mound Growth/ Mount Saint Helens, Washington/ Black lava gives way to new life beneath a smiling sun. I personally like to place this photo in a “float” frame over a lamp so when the lamp is lit, the sunburst really pops./ P/ forest , Pacific Northwest
22/ SunburstGreen2.jpg/ Verdant Forest Sunspot/ Mount Saint Helens, Washington/ Brilliant green leaves shimmer on a cool morning just feet from scorched earth that lava marred. The morning was cold but this view made me stand still and savor the forest./ P/ Pacific Northwest
23/ StHelensCrater.jpg/ Into the Crater/ Mount Saint Helens, Washington/ The hike to Lewit Falls which pours from the famous smoking crater is marvelous. Here I am following the drainage below the falls. One feels as though about to walk into the live volcano itself, though travel beyond the falls is prohibited, and all but impossible thanks to loose and deep ash./ L/ Pacific Northwest
24/ IronCreekFalls.jpg/ Iron Creek Falls/ Washington/ This gorgeous waterfall is only 1/ 4 mile from the highway, but you will feel as though you've travelled to a remote tropical paradise. I had it all to myself for half an hour, surprisingly./ L/ waterfall, forest , Pacific Northwest
25/ PinnacleSummit.jpg/ Pinnacle Peak Summit View/ Mount Rainier, Washington/ Massive Mount Rainier reaches for the sky from the summit of nearby Pinaccle Peak, one of the finest short climbs in the Tatoosh Range. My luck with weather here was great, as this view is often swallowed up in nearby clouds and there is little appeal to this hike and scramble except to stare at Rainier./ L/ summit , Pacific Northwest
26/ SunburstGreen.jpg/ Sunburst Green/ Mount Rainier, Washington/ The Wonderland Trail circles all around Mount Rainier, cutting through some truly magical forests. Here, at late afternoon, neon leaves catch the late light, just before things cooled down and I bunked down for the night./ L/ forest, sunburst , Pacific Northwest
27/ RainforestArch.jpg/ Rainforest Arch/ North Cascades, Washington/ A curved limb hangs over a white froth of river in heavy vegetation on a warm day just a few miles from the Mount Baker Highway./ P/ forest , Pacific Northwest
28/ SahaleSunrise.jpg/ Sahale Summit Sunrise/ North Cascades, Washington/ There may be no finer spot for a sunrise or sunset in all of America. A beautiful remote campground sits just 500 feet below this impressive summit. It is popular with good reason and even for a jaded old mountain man like me, the experience was special. For many, its life-changing./ L/ sunrise, summit , Pacific Northwest
29/ Starfish1.jpg/ Purple Starfish/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ This plump customer is one of many posing in the sun on any given day in Washington./ L/ wildlife, beach, Pacific Northwest
30/ Urchin1.jpg/ Green Urchin/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ Tidepooling can be a game of hit and miss. But when life is present in these tiny little ecosystems, it is beautiful. Note the water bug here./ L/ wildlife, beach , Pacific Northwest
31/ SunbeamSolDuc.jpg/ Splitting a Sunbeam/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ This sunbeam caught my attention for several minutes. I had never seen one quite like it, as if split down center by an axe. This was taken in the amazingly beautiful Sol Duc Forest./ L/ forest, sunburst , Pacific Northwest
32/ SolDucFalls.jpg/ Sol Duc Falls Morning/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ These popular triple falls are easily hiked to by countless visitors every day. Beyond the falls, the trails empty out but remain very beautiful./ P/ waterfall, forest , Pacific Northwest
33/ SolDucForest.jpg/ Sol Duc Forest/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ Old-growth trees tower all around in the Sol Duc Forest while soft red earth beneath is a pleasure to walk on. Thick shade keeps temperatures low even on summer days./ L/ forest , Pacific Northwest
34/ BambiJr.jpg/ Hello from Bambi/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ One benefit of sleeping in a camouflage bivy bag is keeping a low profile, so that shy animals are not scared away. I saw a whole family of deer in a few minutes. This photo turned out great, but I just missed this little cutie scratching at a fly, and looking cute enough to explode a camera./ L/ wildlife, deer , Pacific Northwest
35/ SecretGarden1.jpg/ Secret Garden 1/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ Check out my blog or Summitpost.org page for a story about "The Secret Garden", an unofficial trail that connects two excellent campgrounds and makes for a great half day adventure. The name is my own./ P/ flower , Pacific Northwest
36/ SecretGarden2.jpg/ Secret Garden 2/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ August can bring dry weather and an abundance of wildflowers in WA. "The Secret Garden" offers solitude from the crowds, connecting Oyster Lake and the Catwalk./ L/ flower , Pacific Northwest
37/ MtOlympusWARed.jpg/ Mount Olympus from the Secret Garden/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ "The Secret Garden" trail heads toward Mount Olympus, pristine with glaciers high above humid rainforests. Olympic National Park offers nearly every kind of ecosystem one could desire./ P/ flower , Pacific Northwest
38/ SecretGarden3.jpg/ Secret Garden 3/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ A rainbow underfoot dwarfs this distant forested peak along "The Secret Garden" trail. Check out my blog or Summitpost.org page for a full write-up of this little semi-secret gem./ P/ flower , Pacific Northwest
39/ BaronLakes1.jpg/ Baron Lakes Sunrise/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ This view of the Monte Verita spires was snapped from a sketchy scramble up a peak without name, rarely visited, but well worth the dark morning's struggle! Baron Lakes area is one of my favorites in the world, let alone Idaho./ L/ reflection, sunrise, lake 
40/ ElephantRockMorning.jpg/ Shangri La Sunrise/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ I awoke to this view, camped on a little arm between the first two of the three Shangri La Lakes, accessible by steep, hot, wild climber's trail- not maintained by rangers./ P/ reflection, lake 
41/ ShangriLaLake3.jpg/ Third Shangri La Lake/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ Mount Decker scowls behind this green lonely lake, miles from where even most climbers stop. I made a huge loop hike and climb up the Goat's Perch Mountain and reconnected to the thin trail system at this point.  Check out my Summitpost.org page for a full route description up the Goat's Perch./ L/ reflection, lake 
42/ SawtoothLake1.jpg/ Sawtooth Lake/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ The largest lake in the Sawtooth Range frames Mount Reynolds. There are excellent camping sites here where windy, starry nights can be spent between scrambles up peaks with incredible views./ L/ reflection, lake 
43/ MerrittIDView1.jpg/ Mount Merritt Valley/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ This amazing isolated valley hangs between trails and would prove a fierce test to reach- I am hoping to do so some year soon. Taken from a nearby summit, a mere tedious walk to achieve./ L/ summit 
44/ YellowandBlack.jpg/ Golden Flowers/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ An art filter removing all but the brilliant yellow of these late summer flowers high in the mountains, and late in the summer./ L/ flower, BW 
45/ YellowandBlack2.jpg/ Golden Flowers 2/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ My favorite filter effect in-camera is to remove all but one pigment. It can often make for a startling and pleasing effect./ P/ flower, BW 
46/ FieryLeavesHolbrook.jpg/ Bonfire of Foliage/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ One of my favorite hikes is through little-known Holbrook Canyon, located in Bountiful, UT. The trail is easy, and nothing special most of the year, but offers a peak of autumn color's not easily matched. Scenes like this one are at hand or underfoot for miles./ P/ autumn
47/ ButterflyPounce.jpg/ Ready for Takeoff/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A monarch butterfly prepares to launch off these flowers, captured in the moment just in the nick of time. I only had time for one shot after zooming in, so this picture's perfection was as much luck as skill. But luck favors the prepared, so they say./ L/ wildlife, butterfly 
48/ MiddleTeton.jpg/ Middle Teton from Grand Teton/ Teton Mountains, Wyoming/ The view from where the true climb begins, heading up Grand Teton.  Enough of a warm-up yet? At this point, one has walked 7 steep miles and probably passed a cold night with marmots and other critters crawling about./ P/ summit 
49/ GrandTetonSummit1.jpg/ Grand Teton Summit View 1/ Teton Mountains, Wyoming/ Taken from near the summit of the Grand Teton on a late fall effort deterred by snow, ice, and dwindling daylight. I will need to get back one day. A few hearty people did make it to the summit that day. I made friends with a couple guys who were at it for 14 hours and had to hike out that night!/ L/ summit 
50/ DeltaLakeDay.jpg/ Delta Lake High Noon/ Teton Mountains, Wyoming/ My first glimpse of Delta Lake, approachable only by faint and non-maintained trail, with the Grand Teton's horn high overhead. I camped here and during the night I dreamt a helicopter was over me. I learned a few days later there had been a minor earthquake that night. (I didn't even mention the ice on my sleeping bag.)/ L/ reflection, lake 
51/ Disappointment1.jpg/ Disappointed?/ Teton Mountains, Wyoming/ One of the early attempts to tackle the Grand Teton went up Disappointment Peak, which ends with this intimidating view. No one has been disappointed since! I forced my own route up a steep and rocky coulour and had a rough time of it descending./ P/ summit 
52/ Disappointment2.jpg/ Time to Retreat/ Teton Mountains, Wyoming/ Storms cut my day short, but I could not turn around without snapping a few pictures to remember an amazing day. I managed to stay dry and will never forget the views./ L/ summit 
53/ DeltaStormrise.jpg/ Delta Lake Stormy Sunrise/ Teton Mountains, Wyoming/ I awoke with snow and ice on my bivvy sack, having slept like a baby, and met this sunrise. I waited cold minutes for the Grand Teton to emerge, then had to flee downward. A mild pelting of small hail kept my pace up, and caught me whenever I paused to tie a shoe or take a picture./ L/ reflection, lake 
54/ BlancheFoliage.jpg/ Lake Blanche Aspen Foliage/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ There is no finer trail in Utah for fall foliage than the 3 miles to Lake Blanche. Fishing, camping, and climbing await. There are actually 3 lakes, all nearby, with a beautiful hollow hidden among them that few know about. It is my favorite spot to camp in all of the Wasatch Mountains./ L/ autumn 
55/ GoldSunburst.jpg/ Sunburst and Golden Twins/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The setting sun lights these high mountain aspens into brilliant golden hues. I took a few moments to arrange the sun right between the grasping “hands” of these shining trees./ P/ autumn, sunburst 
56/ BlanchePanBW.jpg/ BW Sunrise Pan of Lake Blanche and Sundial/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The Sundial stands guard on left while Mount Dromedary's hump sits on the right, behind Lake Blanche at sunrise on a cold morning. I would climb the Sundial the next weekend, which is not much of a challenge in summer, though all my ledges had snow or ice on them when I went. More fun that way. This is where the popular main trail feeds and ends./ W/ panorama, BW 
57/ DromedarySunrise.jpg/ Sunrise on Mount Dromedary Reflected/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Mount Dromedary sits sentinel over Lake Anne in the Wasatch, on a biting morning with plenty of fresh air. Camping around Lake Blanche is popular, even with fire prohibitions, hard rocky ground, and wind tunnel chills./ L/ reflection 
58/ SplitHollow.jpg/ SplitRock Hollow in Autumn/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Split Rock Hollow sits just below the Sundial above Lake Blanche. Rarely visited, this is my favorite spot to camp in all of the Wasatch. A large icefall (seasonal) and a bubbling creek sit nearby and it is less than 15 minutes pleasant stroll to any of 3 lakes for fishing. There is no better time to go than the first weeks of September./ P/ autumn 
59/ BlancheFoliage2.jpg/ Kaleidoscope Overhead/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Brilliant foliage glitters in a dreamy pattern on a short rest hiking up with a group to Lake Blanche and Split Rock Hollow. This was my favorite picture of the autumn for 2013. This is a good example of one that most friends ask me why I stopped and what I see. I tell them to wait and see until I develop the print./ P/ autumn 
60/ AbacusIce.jpg/ Abacus Falls Early Autumn Ice/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ This icefall on the flanks of the Sundial ought to be named The Abacus. That is my name for it anyway, and it is popular in winter with climbers after fattening up. The real name is “Sundial Ice”, or so I hear- an unimaginative name./ L/ waterfall, icefall
61/ AspenGroveBW.jpg/ Art Monochrome Aspen Grove Trail/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ This picture frames most of the hike up the Aspen Grove Trail, an autumn gem that leads up to Mount Timpanogos and several other summits, such as Robert's Horn and “The Shoulder”, center left here./ L/ autumn, BW 
62/ RobertsHornSummit.jpg/ Robert's Horn Late Autumn Afternoon Summit View/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Late afternoon fades into evening looking down towards Sundance and Provo Canyon from the summit of Robert's Horn. Camped with a group in the fine shelter below “The Shoulder” and when we awoke we were in a minor blizzard./ L/ autumn, winter, summit 
63/ TimpShelterMoon.jpg/ The Shoulder and the Timp Shelter In Winter/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The Timpanogos shelter sits below The Shoulder of Mount Timpanogos, with the moon overhead, on one of autumn's last weekends. We awoke in a minor blizzard, after hiking up on a warm autumn day. Best of two seasons on one weekend, though the descent was slow./ L/ structure
64/ AspenGroveBlizzard.jpg/ Blizzard on the Aspen Grove Trail/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Having led a group hike up the previous day through sunny and warm autumn foliage, we awoke in morning to a minor blizzard and bundled up to retreat back to our cars and hot drinks./ L/ winter, storm 
65/ NestPackratSunrisePan.jpg/ Sunrise over Packrat Peak/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ This round nest made a great place to stop and capture the red sunrise over Packrat Peak, Monte Verita, and Elk Peak deep in the Sawtooth range on a little morning's scramble. I should have stopped here because the little summit I reached did not beat this view and took me another couple hours of route-finding. Still, that was what I was out for./ W/ sunrise, panorama 
66/ DogRockCR.jpg/ Dog Rock in Capitol Reef/ Capitol Reef National Park, Utah/ One of many interesting rock forms that can change personalities with the light. On most days, this probably blends into the desert and looks unimpressive./ L/ desert, rock 
67/ MeltingFaces.jpg/ Wall of Melting Faces/ Capitol Reef National Park, Utah/ This wall belongs in a horror movie, and I can always pick out "faces" in it./ L/ desert, rock 
68/ RedRocksUtah.jpg/ Red Rocks and Mountain/ Capitol Reef National Park, Utah/ Red Rock country earns its name here, rivaling Mars. The peak in the background is a 10,000 footer, not noteworthy without that distinguishing height./ L/ desert, rock 
69/ WheelerCanyonSnow.jpg/ Wheeler Canyon Winter Still Life/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Wheeler Canyon near Ogden provides a fabulous and easy low altitude trail to enjoy when there is fresh powder but one doesn't want to snowshoe or battle altitude. Great family hiking location./ L/ winter 
70/ ThroneRoom.jpg/ Majesty Must Have Its Throne/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The lower waterfall in Bell's Canyon is spectacular, especially when framed right with these popular granite slabs behind. Most hikers stop here though the higher waterfall is a positive miracle!/ P/ waterfall 
71/ TannersGulchWinter.jpg/ Tanner's Gulch Winter Shot/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The Cottonwood Ridge booms in deep winter on a hike up to the Pfeifferhorn. Can any mountain range offer a more majestic view?/ L/ winter 
72/ RedBaldyStorms.jpg/ Storms From Red Baldy Summit/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Moody shadows swirl over Mount Timpanogos during a spring climb of Red Baldy. I had to beat a quick retreat when hail began to ping me. One of my first climbs or hikes that year and I was not in shape for it./ L/ storm 
73/ SilhouetteSunrise.jpg/ Sunrise Silhouette of Twin Peaks/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The Salt Lake Twin Peaks inspire from every angle, as the familiar backdrop to Salt Lake City. Here the sun just begins to creep over while most residents still slumber away./ L/ sunrise 
74/ GoblinsSepia.jpg/ Two Goblins/  Sepia Stain/ Goblin Valley, Utah/ Harsh sunlight scarred most of my pictures from a visit to famed Goblin Valley, but added a sepia filter produced some satisfying prints./ L/ desert, rock 
75/ GoblinValley1.jpg/ Goblin In the Sun/ Goblin Valley, Utah/ Families adore Goblin Valley because of the easy hiking through remarkable, strange forms like this. In the height of summer, flies will be a problem, along with the searing heat./ P/ desert, rock 
76/ DinoPrint.jpg/ Big Footprint/ Canyonlands National Park, Utah/ This famous view from Canyonlands, near Moab, always looks like a massive dinosaur footprint to me. One of Utah's famous views./ L/ desert 
77/ HazeSunburst.jpg/ Beautiful Inverstion/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ This shot proves that even pollution can be beautiful in this world. Needing an escape into fresh air, I finally reached a summit visible from my home without any trail to its top./ P/ winter 
78/ AntelopeWinter1.jpg/ Path Through Snow on Antelope Island/ Antelope Island, Utah/ Hiking on Antelope Island in the Great Salt Lake can be buggy and sweaty work, but on the right winter day, one finds the sensation of a private world./ L/ winter 
79/ AntelopeWinter2.jpg/ Soft Antelope Sunrise/ Antelope Island, Utah/ Sunrise kisses the long flanks of the distant Wasatch Mountains, across the cold Great Salt Lake from this largest of several islands. There is an entry fee for this state park./ L/ 
80/ GhostFallsZions.jpg/ Ghostly Falls at Zion/ Zion National Park, Utah/ Flowing down into the Emerald Pools, this waterfall greets many hikers every year at Zion National Park. I liked this cone of snow below the thin veil of the falls. Taken in early spring before leaves added green to the higher elevations of the park./ P/ waterfall 
81/ HiddenCanyonGreen.jpg/ Clash of Arms Narrows/ Zion National Park, Utah/ A trail leads right to the mouth of Hidden Canyon, but few go further than the first 1/ 4 mile into the canyon, as waterfall obstacles parse out those who cannot climb around or through them. Some descend the entire canyon, dropping and rappelling hundreds of feet at a time from a high plateau trail./ P/ 
82/ MouthHiddenCanyon.jpg/ Mouth of Hidden Canyon/ Zion National Park, Utah/ This is the view from the end of the trail to Hidden Canyon, which begins below at the distant waterfall. For the ambitious, the day has just begun!/ P/ waterfall, summit 
83/ KolobFramed.jpg/ Kolob Canyon Framed/ Zion National Park, Utah/ A sheer red monolith towers proudly through the trees on a hike in the Kolob section of Zion, known for its bright red and orange rockforms./ L/ desert 
84/ OrangeDoubleArch.jpg/ Double Arch in Kolob Canyons/ Zion National Park, Utah/ In future eras, this mossy double arch will have been cut much deeper, but it is impressive enough already. This is near the end of one of several easy, and nearly flat trails in the Kolob section of Zion Park./ P/ 
85/ SnowtracksDavisCounty.jpg/ Footprints Up The Foothills/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ My footprints track through glittering powder in the foothills of Davis County, among some of the less visited Wasatch peaks. The Davis County peaks do not offer the famous steep bowls and scrambles of the Cottonwoods area, but are great for mild skiing and solitude./ L/ winter 
86/ NotchPeakTrunk.jpg/ Totem Pole Match/ West Deserts, Utah/ There is a 6 mile hike up to the summit of famous Notch Peak, which demands no climbing. A sandy wash works its way up the whole big mountain, passing by this massive tree trunk of interesting colors./ P/ desert 
87/ NotchPeakFeet.jpg/ Take a Break/  Notch Peak Summit/ West Deserts, Utah/ A summit this fine is worth taking a break upon. Remarkable cliffs drop more than 3,000 feet straight down from Notch Peak in Western Utah. This peak can be hiked from the East, but from the West is one of the state's most arduous climbs./ desert, action, summit 
88/ DivingBoard.jpg/ Dive In/ Escalante, Utah/ Dive In to Escalante! This great fin is not far from the Highway 12, and requires but a few minutes of scrambling from the car to reach. I call it “The Diving Board” and it is my favorite spot so far in Escalante./ L/ desert, rock 
89/ BoxLakeReflect1.jpg/ Box Lake Flood Reflected/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Box Lake, one of 3 Payson Lakes, with a campground at hand, is reserved for fishing. Its still waters, here swollen with spring melt, make a stunning still life./ P/ reflection, lake 
90/ OrangePath.jpg/ Holbrook Foliage/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ I discovered this trail a few minutes from my home one autumn day and have frequented it ever since. The trail goes through Holbrook Canyon and is nothing special except when foliage turns. Then for 3 miles it is one of the best secrets in the state./ L/ autumn, path 
91/ FlamingTulips.jpg/ Tulips Aflame/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ Afternoon sun catches these shaded tulips just right to make a smoldering shot. This is one of my favorite captures from the famous Tulip Festival held every spring./ L/ flower, tulip
92/ BabyGoatGNP.jpg/ Are you Kidding Me?/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A baby goat approaches me as mother watches on near Hidden Lake Trail. She was none too concerned, knowing humans offer no harm in the park. Rangers will often rush between animals and people however, as they should not get too comfortable or tamed. Their lives are still wild./ L/ wildlife, goat 
93/ ReynoldsLedgeGNP.jpg/ Every Inch Counts/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ The Dragon's Tail and several other huge peaks look tiny below this narrow ledge on the route up Mount Reynolds on a brilliant blue day. I studied pictures of this peak for years before finally making the ascent./ L/ 
94/ BearhatOverhead.jpg/ Tipping the Cap/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Fabulous Bearhat Mountain, a monster in its own right, seems puny from the summit heights of Mount Reynolds, Hidden Lake between them. A trail goes to the lake far below and there is nearly one up this seemingly insurmountable summit, though it is a steep scramble not for the meek./ L/ lake, summit 
95/ JamesLakesGNP.jpg/ Wild Stepped Pools/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A long but simple hike up to Mount James reveals at last this more wild view down a canyon without trail rarely used to access the peak. One could follow these lakes and make a knife's ridge ascent of Mount James that would be a much greater challenge./ P/ lake, summit 
96/ CliffsTripleDivideGNP.jpg/ Climbing Triple Divide Peak/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ This picture makes my exploits appear more dangerous than they were, though Triple Divide Peak does intimidate all but the hearty. Melt from summit drains into 3 different oceans so don't forget to pour out some water if you can spare it!/ P/ 
97/ WilberFlowerGNP.jpg/ Mount Wilber with Flowers/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ One of the most ferocious mountains in all of Montana is here snarling behind summer's last few blooms near Shangri La. This hanging valley over Iceberg Lake becomes more popular every year, though there is no maintained trail.  Watch for bears!/ P/ flower 
98/ StormsGNP1.jpg/ Stormy Weather in Glacier/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Wild storms bomb the peaks all around from near Logan Pass. Strong winds made this summit view bitterly cold but the experience was worth it, even if could barely use my fingers after each snapped picture.  I need gloves that allow for subtler actions./ L/ storm, summit 
99/ TeakettleGNP1.jpg/ Teakettle Rock/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ An airy arm beyond Mount Oberlin is populated with rock forms that inspire thoughts of Easter Island. I lost myself among the forms for a few hours of fun./ P/ rock 
100/ EasterIsland1.jpg/ Easter Island Statues/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Statues and shapes surround me on "Easter Island" at Glacier National Park, a strange scrambling spot near Logan Pass. The name is my own. The main summit of Mount Oberlin is among the easiest to attain in the park./ L/ rock 
101/ CloudsAttackGNP.jpg/ When Clouds Attack/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A nearby cloud passes by at finger's reach on a short hike waiting for the weather to improve near Logan Pass. I paid a price for hanging around, getting very cold and damp, but could not head down or stop snapping pics./ L/ storm, summit 
102/ SunburstOberlin1.jpg/ Heavenly Halo/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A spotlight comes from high overhead to light some of the famed Logan Pass. Taken from Mount Oberlin, called often the easiest climb in the whole park./ L/ storm, sunburst, summit 
103/ ReynoldsGoat.jpg/ King of the Hill/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ This scout for the herd poses with his powerful frame in front of Mount Reynolds, after deciding I was not a threat, during a climb of Bearhat Mountain. He posed for 5 good minutes for me, with this picture coming out best, before getting a little testy. I had tried to avoid him, spotting him before he knew I was coming. As I started moving upward again, he ran off to alert the herd of my approach./ P/ wildlife, goat 
104/ BearhatHangLedge.jpg/ Grassy Crux Ledge/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ This minor overhang was one of the more challenging moves on a free climb up Bearhat Mountain on a fine autumn day. I could have made things easier than I did, but this move just was too tempting to ignore. I love a minor thrill./ L/ 
105/ BearhatStorms1.jpg/ Dark Shadows/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ No summit in Glacier National Park provides a more central and expansive view than Bearhat, an easy all-day climb. This day was one of the best of my life, with incredible ominous weather, fantastic views, wildlife meetings, a rush down to beat storms, and many memories./ L/ storm, summit 
106/ BearhatStorms2.jpg/ Sinister Clouds/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Looking toward Preston Park, I decide I'd best start heading down, with 4 hours minimum left to reach the car. I stayed dry somehow!/ L/ storm, summit 
107/ BearhatStorms3.jpg/ Stripe of Sunlight/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A single stripe of daylight peaks out of writhing storms atop Bearhat Mountain, one of my favorite trips to date. A day I will never forget,and I have pictures from this climb all over my walls at home./ L/ storm, summit 
108/ ShatteredRock.jpg/ Shattered Rock/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Evidence of time and weather on display/  each year freezing and thawing breaks rocks apart, reshaping the mountains. This remarkable rock is still recognizable as once being a single one, a little “Pangea” breaking apart and drifting away./ P/ rock 
109/ IcebergPeakShadow.jpg/ Shadow Climber/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Andrew David proves his own presence on a solo trip up Iceberg Peak, one of 3 peaks topped that particular day. Iceberg Lake sits 3,000 feet below. This one earned its name as I contended with snow and icicles, as well as scree and sliding rocks./ L/ lake, action, summit, shadow 
110/ SunsetAhernPeak.jpg/ Very High Sunset/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ I passed a windy and cold night alone atop Ahern Peak (with permission) after climbing Iceberg Peak and preparing to do Ipasha the next morning. No water was within miles and I was too dehydrated and weak to finish Ipasha, so I will need to go back one summer./ L/ sunset, summit 
111/ AdamsFallsWinter.jpg/ Adams Falls In Winter/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Adams Canyon is popular year-round, and at low elevation demands little gear or hard effort. This fall rarely freezes enough to climb, but still makes a sight. A good dog hike in Davis County./ P/ waterfall, winter, icefall 
112/ StewartsPlusFoliage.jpg/ Stewarts Cascades Behind A Burst of Foliage/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Stewart's Cascades hangs partly frozen behind the last reminder of autumn on a snowshoe trip near Sundance. This waterfall is special because it rarely freezes entirely, making for great photography. When it is frozen solid, it makes for great climbing./ L/ winter, waterfall, icefall
113/ StewartsWinter.jpg/ Stewart's Cascades In Winter/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Near Sundance, this remarkable huge waterfall sits in shade all winter, sometimes climbed, often admired. Here it is only half frozen, creating a beautiful effect./ P/ waterfall, winter, icefall
114/ DoughnutFallsWinter.jpg/ Doughnut Falls Frozen/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Popular in summer, the crowds can be avoided by heading up to the Doughnut Falls cave in winter. Dress warm! This is one of my favorite pictures from the winter of 2013. A perfect shot from a perfect day to creep into this icy, still cave./ P/ winter, waterfall, icefall
115/ IceClimbStairway1.jpg/ Ice Climbers on Stairway to Heaven/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ One of Utah's famous icewalls, fat during a cold front makes climbers happy on a bright day./ L/ winter, action 
116/ BearhatSunburstPan1.jpg/ Bearhat Divided by Light/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A remote valley is lit by heavenly light between clouds from Bearhat Mountain's wide and beautiful summit./ W/ panorama, storm, sunburst, summit 
117/ BearhatSunPan2.jpg/ Preston Park Panorama/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A popular, but remote area near the Sperry Glacier is lit with a bruise of storms from the summit of Bearhat Mountain. Views in every direction were incredible on this day./ W/ panorama, storm, summit 
118/ GSLTelephoneReflect.jpg/ Stay in Touch/ Utah/ The Great Salt Lake, shallow in summer, reflects these old, anachronistic telephone poles in the soft light of a muted morning./ L/ reflection, sunrise 
119/ MortonSunrise.jpg/ Salty Sunrise/ Utah/ The Morton Salt Factory on the Great Salt Lake has never looked finer than it did on this specatular morning, the mountains but shadow behind./ L/ sunrise, reflection 
120/ TwoMedPanNoon.jpg/ Health to the Eyes and Heart/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ This view from the top of Flinsch's Horn overlooks the Two Medicine area to the north, taking in Mount Morgan and the Dawson Pass goat trail. I covered over 20 miles this day./ W/ panorama, summit 
121/ GoingToSunPan.jpg/ Going to the Sun Road/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ America has many fine roads, but none can surpass the engineering wonder and natural awe of the Going to the Sun Road through Glacier Park, even with traffic and construction, problems nearly every season! This road truly is an engineering marvel, and driving it, one wonders not only at the completion of construction, but at the very conception! Some engineers really know how to dream. This panorama is best in the 1/ 2 ratio./ W/ panorama 
122/ SiyehFromGouldPan.jpg/ Mount Siyeh and Mount Allen/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Taken from Mount Gould on another stormy adventure, several massive mountains huddle under storms in late afternoon. I pioneered a new route up Mount Siyeh, or one that had not been well-documented previously anyway. Someone likely tried it before me.  For full details check out my Summitpost.org page. This panorama is best in the 1/ 2 ratio./ W/ panorama, storm, summit 
123/ GouldColorWidePan.jpg/ Summit of Mount Gould/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Mount Grinnell, Salamander Glacier, and Upper Grinnell Lake take center stage with Icerberg Peak, and Mount Merritt, among others, dark and ominous in the distance. I would be lying if I said lightning were not on my brain at this point, but I was not to be deterred on this day. I made it back to trail before rain began to soak me hard./ W/ panorama, storm, lake, summit 
124/ AhernSunsetPan.jpg/ Sunset on the Iceberg Wall/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ One of my last views for the night before countless stars came out to keep me company was this brilliant alpine glow South of Ahern Peak, my rocky bed. I had to lie still during the night as the scree I was on was not level and kept shifting toward the precipice./ W/ panorama, sunset, summit 
125/ IpashaMerritNoonPan.jpg/ Mount Merritt and Mount Ipasha/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Taken from Iceberg Peak, Lake Helen hangs alone in her cirque beneath this amazing scene in the sunlight./ W/ panorama, lake, summit 
126/ BlancheGold1.jpg/ Riches of Foliage/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Aspens quake with a wealth of color nearing Lake Blanche. This was my first autumn hike after moving to Utah. Can you blame me for becoming hooked? This is a photo taken with my older camera and so, is not suggested for prints larger than 11X17. Still, it is too nice to throw away./ L/ autumn 
127/ GoingToSunPan2.jpg/ Sunrise on the Going to the Sun Road/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ From just off the famous road through the park, Mt Reynolds, Heavy Runner Mountain, and others glitter. The Going to the Sun Road is a must for any visitor, and can be driven privately, by free shuttle, or with paid tour options. If driving yourself, start early, as you can avoid the traffic and stops./ W/ panorama, sunrise 
128/ GuertsOlympusWinter.jpg/ Geurt's Ridge in Winter/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Most people hike up Mount Olympus, but some choose to scramble and climb up these spires that stretch to the summit. Rope and gear are required as some rappels must be done./ L/ winter 
129/ OlympusWinterStill1.jpg/ Still Life At 10,000 Feet/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Untouched powder on a lonely and cold trip up Mount Olympus over Salt Lake City made for some impressive still scenes. I sweated quite heavily to earn views like these./ L/ winter 
130/ WheelerSnowballs.jpg/ Snowballs Overhead/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Fresh snow clings to bare limbs overhead in Wheeler Canyon with dry ground underfoot, and blue skies far above. Wheeler Canyon is excellent for dogs and families in winter, and rarely requires snowshoes or any kind of gear. Try the Icebox Canyon branch trail for added fun and solitude./ L/ winter 
131/ DogLakeSunBurstWinter.jpg/ What Do You See?/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ On a group hike up to Dog Lake, I was asked "what do you see?" as I stopped to snap this picture. No one else thought much of the scenery, but the result was worthwhile, I think. Having forgotten sunscreen, I was redder than a lobster by day's end and “lost” my whole face in the next week. Lesson learned!/ P/ winter, sunburst 
132/ BellsFallsShade.jpg/ Lower Bell's Canyon Falls/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Taken from the deep shade, just out of the spray, the fabulous Lower Bell's Canyon Falls shimmer. I try to hike up this trail once every year, or more./ P/ waterfall 
133/ SnowshoesCenterville.jpg/ Take a Breather/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ There was less snow on the summit ridge I finally gained than for most of the hike up, so I left my snowshoes as I strolled about for a bit before fleeing storms. In a white matte with red or orange trim, this photo looks amazing at any size!/ L/ storm, winter, action 
134/ SilverLakeWBaldyReflect.jpg/ Silver Lake Silent/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The actually green waters of Silver Lake reflect the intimidating granite flanks of White Baldy, a bulging huge citadel central to the Cottonwoods which makes for hard climbing and long hours, no matter which trail one starts from./ P/ reflection, lake 
135/ SilverLakeZebraReflect.jpg/ Silver Lake Zebra Cliffs/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Silver Lake reflects late spring snow and black and white striated cliffs. There are actually 3 Silver Lakes, one man-made, this one which is Silver Lake proper, and then a smaller little secret with no trail leading to it named Silver Lake Glance./ L/ reflection, lake 
136/ RedBaldyStorms2.jpg/ Ring of Water/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A ring of Silver Lake Glance has melted out, Mount Timpanogos behind, and a small wooded horn in the foreground as I ascend Red Baldy's slopes. This is a quiet, pristine place to camp if you have any route-finding skills, or a decent guide./ L/ storm, lake 
137/ CottonwoodRidgeStorm.jpg/ Cottonwood Ridge/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The amazing long Cottonwood Ridge dividing Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons snarls under an approaching hailstorm. The storm and I raced back down. This was my first ever view of the entire ridge, and it (along with the elevation) took my breath away./ L/ storm 
138/ FlowerMeadowDraper.jpg/ Wildflower Slopes/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Many flowers bloom on the sloping foothills of this trail leading into the high mountains. Scrub oak forests took over a few minutes later, eventually yielding to pine trees and snow./ L/ flower 
139/ UpperBells1.jpg/ Upper Bell's Waterfall/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The higher of the two famed falls in Bell's Canyon here rockets around a tree and crashes with fury into rocks below, a blistering diamond under the sun. This is a magnificent cold spot for a lunch any day of the summer./ P/ waterfall 
140/ LightningRidge1.jpg/ Lightning Ridge/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Snapped from Thunder Mountain, this shows the whole jagged, sheer Lightning Ridge which I followed, admiring the cliffs below. A fun long day of hiking in the high mountains, escaping from high 90 degrees below in the valley./ P/ 
141/ BroadsForksForestGreen.jpg/ Shades of Green/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Up the steep path to the Broad's Fork Meadow lie some of the prettiest forest you could ask for, with a mix of aspens and pines. Moose are known to frequent this area, so keep a sharp eye and try to make noise. You do not want to startle a moose./ L/ forest 
142/ BroadsForksMeadow1.jpg/ Reaching the Meadow/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ This meadow gives way to a rugged talus field, littered with avalanche debris. In early summer, Broad's Fork is a shimmering emerald dream, ideal for base camps and mountaineering. Seasonal waters tumble and cascade between huge rocks of red and black hues and patterns./ L/ 
143/ FlowersPlusPfeifferhorn.jpg/ Flowers Plus Pfeifferhorn/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Near the summit of the Broad's Fork Twin Peaks, these pink flowers bloom with mighty peaks behind.Taken in late afternoon, with showers threatening all around, but never hitting me./ P/ flower, summit
144/ SunriseTwinStorms.jpg/ Afternoon Storms Over Sunrise Peak/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Taken from the summit of the Broad's Fork Twin Peaks, the sky suddenly causes me some concern to the East. I headed down in a hurry- after taking several more pictures./ L/ storm, summit 
145/ DromedaryStorms1.jpg/ Storms Along Cottonwood Ridge/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Doing my favorite activity (storm chasing) while mountaineering, this view looks East along the rocky ridge of connected high peaks./ P/ storm, summit 
146/ SunsetGSL1.jpg/ Sunset Over Great Salt Lake/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Antelope Island and dark pine trees create intriguing layers of shading here with the moon coming out at last light. A fine night for camping./ P/ sunset, summit 
147/ SunriseFrancesFlowers.jpg/ Sunrise from Frances Peak/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A few late summer flowers bask in the orange light of early dawn from near Frances Peak, one of my favorite spots for a sunrise or a sunset. A good dirt road passable to most cars leads almost to this very spot, making overnight trips with friends new to Utah and mountain altitudes, a snap./ P/ sunrise, flower, summit 
148/ FrancesRoadNight.jpg/ Road to Frances Peak/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Few ATVers were out this evening, until after dark, which made for more quiet camping than one can usually get in this area. Here is a view of the upper stretches of the dirt road system leading to Frances Peak./ L/ sunset, summit 
149/ GSLSunsetRed.jpg/ Tiny Red World Below/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Hunched in some short grasses, I capture the sinking sun just over the horizon the Great Salt Lake makes thousands of feet below. Frances Peak offers a great view of the lake and sunsets./ L/ sunset, summit 
150/ DoughnutSummer1.jpg/ Doughnut Falls/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The famous popular waterfall comes pouring through the hole it chipped out many seasons ago, a bright gasp of blue. Go on a weekday to avoid insufferable crowds. This hike is short and sweet. One of Utah's most popular. To reach the cave does involve some scrambling, and probably getting wet until later summer./ P/ waterfall 
151/ CamilaActionWhoo.jpg/ What a Wonderful World/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Whoo! What a beautiful day in the mountains. My lovely friend was excited on her first trip to Utah after hearing me praise the state./ L/ action 
152/ WolverineFlowers.jpg/ Mount Wolverine Wildflowers/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Blossoms on a rocky summit await those willing to hike but a few miles. This is Mount Wolverin's summit, reached easily enough from Brighton Ski Resort after passing a series of lovely tarns and lakes./ P/ flower 
153/ GendarmeWBaldy.jpg/ Gendarme with Lake Below/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Scrambling from the Pfeifferhorn to White Baldy on a beautiful warm day, we tackled several gendarmes, none so impressive as this one. The climbing was tedious but breaks and scenery make the exercise far more valued than being at home or in the gym./ P/ rock 
154/ WBPfeifferhornRidge.jpg/ Rocky Ridgeline/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The Pfeifferhorn looks miraculously small only hours after we graced her summit before heading to White Baldy. This long ridge is part of what many in Utah know as the Bullion Divide, a very long scramble taking in several 11,000 ft summits./ P/ summit 
155/ AutumnAlchemy.jpg/ Autumn's Alchemy/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A hike through Bear Fork is memorable from top to bottom, and that is the best way to tackle this steep canyon! The views never let up when coming out Bear Fork, as once finally below tree line and losing sight of the nearby mountains, beautiful forest delights./ P/ autumn 
156/ DesolationColors.jpg/ Desolation Lake in Autumn/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Taken from Silver Peak, Gobbler's Knob Mountain and Desolation Lake show the best of fall. Desolation Lake has some fine flat forested spots for camping and serves as a good stopover for bikers, hikers, and possibly fishermen. The lake is shallow, so I doubt many large meals await./ L/ autumn, lake 
157/ WheresWaldo.jpg/ Where's Waldo?/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Can you spot my friend scrambling up this knife's ridge from Hidden Peak to the American Fork Twins? Sadly, this storm was a surprise and I was in shorts- the last time I ever made such a mistake. I did have a cap and gloves at very least./ P/ action, winter 
158/ SnowSpeckleRocks.jpg/ Speckled Rocks/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Fierce winds and fresh snow decorated every rock on our climb this cold day, producing many great shots, and many shivers. If only I'd dressed warmer and been prepared for flash storms./ L/ winter 
159/ ClawBareTrees.jpg/ Claws Reach for the Sun/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ These stark trees grasp at the sun through a cold and dark haze. A friend and I had the trail to Box Elder Peak (in the Wasatch- there are several by that name in Utah) to ourselves with flurries and thunder in November./ L/ winter, sunburst, storm
160/ NorthsCanyonSnow.jpg/ Private Powder/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A hike close to my house feeds into fresh powder few ever suspect. North's Canyon is one of the best winter secrets in Utah as you can get in mild slopes and bowls with no company, or with only your friends. The entire approach hike is fine too./ P/ winter, sunburst 
161/ DeerRoadLooking.jpg/ Who are You?/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Early in the morning, this deer is surprised to see me coming her way near the Payson Lakes. Hundreds of campers snored away while we had our moment./ L/ wildlife, deer 
162/ LongArmofGravity.jpg/ The Long Arm of the Law of Gravity/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The easy West Slabs route up Mount Olympus's North summit is plenty of fun with the whole city and valley lying below. The walls are not vertical in most places and offer solid knobs and handholds to allow captures like this without danger. Don't mistake it for a hike though./ P/ action, shadow 
163/ FeetLedgeAction.jpg/ Don't Do Anything I Wouldn't Do/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Not sure of the next move, I snapped this picture to commemorate just how much fun I was having on a free climb day. I made the top of this little cliff just fine, noticing several slings left by climbers using ropes and protection from the year before. I had to lunge just a bit on the next move./ P/ action 
164/ AspenTallGold.jpg/ Tall Aspen Soldiers/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Uniform yellow beauty hangs high atop the lollipop sticks of white aspen trunks beneath a hint of brilliant blue. Taken in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Utah has colors in the fall to rival Colorado even./ L/ autumn, forest 
165/ PuzzleofLeaves.jpg/ Puzzle of Leaves/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ I took this photo thinking I could print it as a puzzle for myself, but it makes a great card or wall decoration too. I love it with a black matte to bring out that half-buried rock near the center./ L/ autumn 
166/ FarmingtonFalls.jpg/ Farmington Falls Beyond/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ This beautiful waterfall in late summer was a veil of gentle mist. A pleasant hike of a few miles gives way to a short scramble down a steep dry slide. Then a few boulder hops put one right by the falls. In spring, this same scene can be a froth of raging mist beneath a torrent./ P/ waterfall 
167/ SouthLonePeak.jpg/ South Lone Peak/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The Question Mark Wall and Southern Summit of Lone Peak stand far below the main summit of the famed peak. 1,000 feet of cliffs fall straight down, begging the question/  who packed the parachute?/ L/ summit 
168/ BlancheFoliage3.jpg/ Rainbow Forest/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ These red berries look pretty, but taste terrible. Several other varieties of berry grow nearby however, sweet to taste. On the way to Lake Blanche it is easy to pick them and have a little snack. Watch for moose./ L/ autumn, forest 
169/ TimpTrailSummer.jpg/ Trail to Timpanogos/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Late in the season the summit of Mount Timpanogos melts out and looks like a harsh scorched world of its own. On weekends this stretch of trail is often teeming with red-faced, short-winded people. This is from one of the Wasatch's highest peaks./ L/ path 
170/ TwinPeakReflect.jpg/ Twin Peaks Reflected/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ In this still, quiet beaver pond, the Broad's Fork Twin Peaks wink down. This is your last chance for water after July 1, if attempting to climb these peaks./ L/ lake, reflection 
171/ ColoFoliageSunspot.jpg/ Gold Grabbing the Gold/ Colorado/ Beautiful aspen trees frame this sunburst on a short stroll in a beautiful glade we spotted from the highway and took the time to stop at. A few short dirt trails weaved between tall trees and near a few ponds near Rifle, Colorado./ P/ autumn, forest, sunburst 
172/ ColoGoldLakeReflect.jpg/ What a Rest Stop/ Colorado/ This inspiring little pond is part of a rest stop near the town of Rifle. Here, a glade of golden aspens are reflected on a still day. What a way to be welcomed just a little while after crossing the state line!/ L/ autumn, reflection, lake 
173/ BearhatLongPano.jpg/ Logan Pass From Bearhat Summit/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Hidden Lake stretches out below Mount Reynolds and the Logan Pass summits from the remarkable top of Bearhat Mountain on a day of mixed weather. Bearhat makes a great full-day excursion. A trail leads to the lake below and then it is up to the adventurer to find a way to the top, with many options possible./ W/ panorama, storm, summit 
174/ AntelopeSunriseSwirl.jpg/ A Bruise of Sunrise/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A writhing fission of storms and sun wrestle above the Wasatch Mountains in this rare photo of mine taken from the valley. I had not even reached the trailhead but spotted this shock of a morning in the rearview mirror and pulled the car to a stop by the roadside./ L/ sunrise, storm, sunburst 
175/ GandalfPoint.jpg/ Gandalf Point/ Zion National Park, Utah/ Thou shalt not pass? Near the mouth of Hidden Canyon, the ground gets wet and most turn around, but the canyon keeps getting better for the feet of foot. AS long as water is low, there is no need to freeze your feet. A small arch and several small waterfalls await deeper in the canyon./ L/ rock 
176/ ColumbiaGorgeFlowers.jpg/ Columbia Gorge Wildflowers/ Columbia Gorge, Oregon/ Golden sunflowers cluster in open meadows high above the waters of the Columbia Gorge below. The far side of the river is Washington while the meadow I was in is Oregon./ L/ flower 
177/ ColumbiaGorgeFlowers2.jpg/ Columbia Gorge Wildflowers/ Columbia Gorge, Oregon/ Golden sunflowers cluster in open meadows high above the waters of the Columbia Gorge below. The state of Washington is visible across the river./ L/ flower 
178/ OneontaGorge1.jpg/ Oneonta Gorge/ Columbia Gorge, Oregon/ A cold trot through waters sometimes waist high on a spring morning was worth the shivers. It took me quite a while to warm up after this little adventure in early spring. I saw only fishermen and photographers in thermal waders for the day. They thought I was crazy, but its good to test one's limits sometimes./ P/ 
179/ StormsHood.jpg/ Stormy Sunrise Drifts/ Mount Hood, Oregon/ An aborted effort up Mount Hood did not keep me from enjoying a brisk morning high in the mountains before turning around. I hopped back into bed and did not regret the early exercise./ L/ storm, winter 
180/ SnowyTreesHood.jpg/ Snowy Trees/ Mount Hood, Oregon/ These cold trunks huddle together against freezing winds and snow. While staying with a friend at the Timberline Lodge with a friend, we were treated to lots of fresh snow and cold temperatures though most of Oregon was already green and splendid./ P/ winter, forest 
181/ BlizzardTreesHood.jpg/ Snowy Trees in a Blizzard/ Mount Hood, Oregon/ These cold trunks bear the brunt of a winter storm while huddling together. A whirl of snowflakes kept off the lens just long enough to capture a good shot./ P/ winter, forest, storm 
182/ SnowyPinesHood.jpg/ Fresh Powder and Pine Trees/ Mount Hood, Oregon/ The early light of dawn found me on these rolling hills of fresh powder in snowshoes with only pine trees for company after an early rise at the Timberline Lodge. I could not complain and kept out in the wind and snow for a few hours./ L/ winter, forest 
183/ JaguarCard.jpg/ Jaguar Sitting with Text/ Portland Zoo/ This big cat obeys my commands, like all mighty animals, and gave me a sitting. Still, he tells it how it is. Personally,I think this one particularly clever in my bathroom. Makes a smart card as well./ L/ wildlife, text 
184/ JaguarSit.jpg/ Jaguar Sitting/ Portland Zoo/ This big cat obeys my commands, like all mighty animals and gave me a sitting. What a good model, no? This is a version without text added to the photo./ L/ wildlife 
185/ LoneRose.jpg/ Precocious Rose/ Portland, Oregon/ The wonderful city park of Oregon held this solitary rose in a cold, wet spring. Even the nearby Rose Gardens were bare, but I think the effect here is magnificent. I caught a flicker of red driving the winding road, and pulled to a stop at the first opportunity, then went running back up the road trying to find my apparition./ L/ flower, forest 
186/ OrangeInGreen.jpg/ Touch of Orange/ Portland, Oregon/ A few dry, burned leaves add just a bit of contrast and color to the verdant exuberance of a Northwest rainforest./ P/ forest 
187/ TwoPathMist.jpg/ Two Paths Meet in A Mist/ Saddle Mountain, Oregon/ A quick jaunt up this peak on a rainy day provided few views, but good exercise and some impressive misty shots. I managed not to slip though I was motoring at high pace./ L/ path 
188/ MossHoleBeach.jpg/ Neon Moss, Rock Bridge and Ocean/ Oregon Coast/ Every beach I have been to in Oregon has had a unique look. Here, while tidepooling, I walked some bridges over crashing cold waves. One freak wave, a giant to the rest, caught me and soaked me to the shoulders./ P/ beach 
189/ OregonBeach1.jpg/ Coastal Pyramid/ Oregon Coast/ Broken stones keep my feet dry while a moon-like pyramid squats out in the deeper water./ L/ beach 
190/ SunburstSteepFerns.jpg/ Steep Wet Ferns/ Humbug Mountain State Park, Oregon/ A mix of rain and sun made for a magical jog on springy ground to a small summit near the coast. Highly recommended. 6 miles complete a loop through a beautiful forest, with a few fleeting ocean views./ P/ forest 
191/ SilverForestPrimal.jpg/ Silver Forest Primal/ Humbug Mountain State Park, Oregon/ Smoke in the backdrop and old-growth, thin sentinels of trees make this one of my favorite pictures. Its typically up on one of my walls. I love it framed in an orange matte or on orange card stock./ P/ forest 
192/ PathThroughEden.jpg/ Path Through Eden/ Humbug Mountain State Park, Oregon/ Near Humbug Mountain's summit, the forest let in more light. Mossy logs dotted the soft trailsides and the air warmed. This picture is one of my favorite captures of a path, a beautiful still life./ P/ forest, path 
193/ FlowerUnderFern.jpg/ Protective Fern/ Humbug Mountain, Oregon/ A purple flower is sheltered from the sun by a nurturing fern. Beauty finds a way./ P/ flower 
194/ WavesBlackBeach.jpg/ Arizona Beach Waves/ Oregon Coast/ Black sand and blue waters raging in a white froth spending themselves against the shore- what else do you need?/ L/ beach 
195/ TatooedRocks.jpg/ Tattooed Rocks/ Escalante, Utah/ After miles of stunning slot canyons, Red Breaks area opens up into strange rock patterns created by wind and other forces. There are few stretches of Escalante that do not yield some inspiration or surprise./ L/ desert, rock 
196/ EastRatPanoBorder.jpg/ Elk Peak and Redfish Lakes Panorama/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ Elk Peak, an elegant and remote mountain reposes over the Upper Redfish Lakes as seen from the summit of Mount Alpen. I climbed this particular peak by mistake, looking for the wild Feather Lakes, surrounded on all sides by peaks and jagged walls. Once I noticed the stunning view around me, I was glad of the error, however, and I made it to my lakes early the next morning./ W/ lake, summit, panorama 
197/ GouldStormPanBW.jpg/ Mount Gould Monochrome Summit View/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Mount Grinnell, Upper Grinnell Lake, and Salamander Glacier fill the foreground with Angel Wing on the right. Behind and distant famed peaks get bombed with heavy storms. I upped the contrast and exposure and filtered all but the blue tones in this picture to create a strong, bold print. This is also available in full color. This panorama is best in 1/ 2 ratio./ W/ BW, storm, panorama, summit 
198/ GrandXPano.jpg/ South Kaibob Vista/ Grand Canyon, Arizona/ X Marks the Spot below as canyons deep and sheltered criss-cross, waiting for the strong hiker to arrive along the South Kaibob Trail. I made 42 miles on foot in 48 hours on this particular short trip in late February. This panorama is best in 1/ 2 ratio./ W/ desert, summit, panorama 
199/ CathedralPano.jpg/ Worshipping from the Cathedral/ Uinta Mountains, Utah/ This gem of a mountain is The Cathedral of the Uintas. Rugged and remote, there are scrambles and climbs to obtain this view far from signs of man. In early summer, several of the summits of the Cathedral can be reached via ice or hard snow climbs while the main summit is just a long boulder hop./ W/ panorama, summit 
200/ SahaleSunrisePano.jpg/ Sunrise From Sahale Peak/ North Cascades, Washington/ Forbidden Peak sits left and Boston Peak's round crown is on the right with the first light of day glittering gold behind. I spent the morning working my way to and up Boston Peak, and then back down to camp just below the Sahale Glacier. Broke camp by noon, regretfully. This really is one of the Cascade's most popular places for a lot of reasons!/ W/ sunrise, summit 
201/ SnowysidePano.jpg/ Snowyside Summit Looking West/ Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho/ Many lakes and many peaks glitter in early summer atop Mount Snowyside, one of the highest, but gentlest mountains in the Sawtooth range. The ascent is tedious due to several false summits that kept tricking me into thinking I had made it./ W/ panorama, winter, summit 
202/ BroadsForkGreen.jpg/ Sterling Green Gate/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Near where the Broad's Fork trail opens into the meadow early summer leaves are almost impossibly green./ L/ 
203/ TwinPeaksUhOh.jpg/ Better Head Down.../ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Caught up in a climb, I suddenly realize upon topping out that I may not want to linger. Luckily I had a camp set up just a few thousand feet below. The night stayed dry and cleared, and I was treated to a fabulous sunset, and thousands of twinkling stars./ L/ storm 
204/ RaymondGobberFromTwins.jpg/ Green Eternity/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Mount Raymond, Gobbler's Knob, and more popular peaks catch late afternoon light atop Twin Peaks. Camping near the foot of the mountain means one can tarry to the best parts of the day, such as late evening./ L/ summit 
205/ BlancheFromAbove.jpg/ Sisters Lakes From Mount Dromedary/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Lake Blanche and her sisters glitter far below on an ascent of Mount Dromedary. An off-trail scramble is possible to descend to those lakes but wear boots with good tread, and only try it when the snow is melted away./ L/ lake, summit 
206/ DromedarySteps.jpg/ Dromedary Steps/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Sheer from afar, Mount Dromedary proves nothing but a natural stairway upon closer inspection. Here are the last few steps before reaching the sky. This is a popular Wasatch Peak with good reason, offering beautiful views of the nearby Twin Peaks and the Lake Blanche area./ L/ rock 
207/ WheelerBurstWithTree.jpg/ Mount Wheeler Sunburst/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ Starting the hike up to Mount Wheeler, the sky seems a little conflicted, if not ominous above one thin tree with a few leaves unshed. Stark beauty called me on though and I had a great day in late autumn./ P/ sunburst 
208/ WheelerBlueBursts.jpg/ Blue Sky Streaking/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ The easy but lung-stretching stomp up the highest peak in the park provided stunning shots of sunstreaks over the desert, all with my feet cold in November snow. The desert is more charming far below thanks to this blue winter underfoot./ L/ sunburst 
209/ WheelerDescent.jpg/ Descending Wheeler Peak/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ Looking back down the short walk, one can't think about returning in later winter with skis some year. The desert is dry and warm far below./ L/ winter, desert, summit 
210/ PyramidNVShoulder.jpg/ One More Peak While Here/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ I had to go stroll over to this peak after ascending Pyramid Peak. Didn't I? The clouds swallowed me, which was added fun, though my views were replaced with a gray blur and I could barely see one step in front of me./ L/ 
211/ NVPyramidSummit.jpg/ From the top of the Pyramid/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ A little far-distant foliage dots the forest yellow from the summit of a satisfying, remote peak shaped perfectly like a pyramid in one of Nevada's many mountain chains./ L/ summit 
212/ HolbrookSnowyTrees.jpg/ Holbrook Canyon Fresh Snow on Trees/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ One of the canyons I lived by for many years is always satisfying after fresh snow. And very few Utahns ever even hear of this little gem named Holbrook Canyon. A spur trail heads up the Session Mountains and provides a charming view of the Bountiful LDS Temple from above./ P/ winter 
213/ SnowyTreeUp.jpg/ Looking Up at Snowy Branches/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Taken in Holbrook Canyon, a low elevation secret, perfect anytime there is fresh snowfall. The trail can usually be travelled without snowshoes, so long as your boots are waterproof./ P/ winter 
214/ GhostFootprints.jpg/ Ghostly Tracks/ Starved Rock State Park, Illinois/ A snow-covered log sits caught in the soft, thin ice of this frozen lake at the most beautiful spot in Illinois, known mainly for seasonal waterfalls./ P/ winter 
215/ BigIcicleIL.jpg/ One Big Icicle/ Starved Rock State Park, Illinois/ Jagged teeth of ice hang down with afternoon sun peaking out above in a deep cold canyon at Starved Rock State Park./ P/ icefall, winter, waterfall 
216/ LaSalleIce.jpg/ La Salle Falls Frozen/ Starved Rock State Park, Illinois/ This beautiful icicle has a walking trail right behind it, allowing for many different views, all enjoyable. A fine network of trails at Starved Rock State Park take in over a dozen falls./ L/ icefall, winter, waterfall 
217/ LaSalleIceBehind.jpg/ La Salle Falls Frozen From Behind/ Starved Rock State Park, Illinois/ Light catches the La Salle Icefall just right from behind in a shallow cave. I got lucky on a trip to visit this area as there had been no precipitation most of the winter until the week before I came. The thaw began a few days after I left, so I could easily have not seen any icefalls on my trip./ P/ icefall, winter, waterfall 
218/ IceBasket1.jpg/ Ice Basket Below St Louis Falls/ Starved Rock State Park, Illinois/ Water trickling down freezes solid while hollowing out the core of this basket. Don't you just want to climb right in? This photo always draws interest on my walls, as it is so unusual./ P/ waterfall, icefall, winter 
219/ IceFallUp.jpg/ Looking Up St Lois Falls in Winter/ Starved Rock State Park, Illinois/ Water trickles down, half freezing. Icicles began to come down as the day warmed./ P/ waterfall, winter, icefall 
220/ IceBasket2.jpg/ Ice Basket Below St Louis Falls/ Starved Rock State Park, Illinois/ A zoom in of this remarkable ice basket catching the cold water as it comes down St Louis Falls. This photo always draws interest on my walls, as it is so unusual./ P/ winter, icefall, waterfall 
221/ StLouisFalls1.jpg/ St Louis Falls/ Starved Rock State Park, Illinois/ Hanging icicles came crashing down just a little after snapping this photo as I watched. The day warmed and conditions are rarely just right for a solid freeze anymore. Icefalls and waterfalls at Starved Rock are seasonal and so can be difficult to visit and enjoy, except to locals. I got lucky with my timing on this particular trip./ P/ waterfall, icefall, winter 
222/ MonumentSunrise1.jpg/ Monument Sunrise/ Monument Valley, Arizona/ Orange and black make a simple and perfect silhouette of the most famous desert formations in America. What a perfect morning. Many Westerns were filmed among these famous landmarks./ P/ sunrise 
223/ NVSunbursts2.jpg/ Sunbursts over the Desert/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ The desert looks splendid between these many haloes far below the powder I was walking in./ L/ sunburst 
224/ JeffDavis1.jpg/ Jefferson Davis Peak from Wheeler Summit/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ The unfortunately-named peak here is rarely climbed as its neighbor is much easier and taller. There are routes up that require no special gear from most sides, however, for the adventurous./ L/ winter, summit 
225/ WheelerLakeCold.jpg/ Wheeler Peak Cirque Reflected/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ Descending Wheeler Peak, I stopped a moment to take in this late afternoon view before trekking on to my tent and trying to warm up. A few were fishing, well-bundled. The campground near the base of Wheeler Peak was crowded, but I was the only tent camper on the first weekend of November./ L/ winter, reflection, lake 
226/ NVLakeBasin1.jpg/ Baker Lake Basin/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ Enclosed by high jagged walls, this is a popular half day hike during the "busy" seasons. Still, you'll find plenty of solitude in this desert oasis. Rocks underfoot are scoured with interesting patterns and many colors, reminding one that many deserts were once ocean floors./ P/ reflection, lake, desert 
227/ NVPyramidSummit2.jpg/ This Lake Should Have a Name/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ This lake has no name, at least not officially on maps, but with the strange mixed lighting, I thought it took on a kind of chilling charm. I descended to its waters and took a small lunch break. The loop hike in the park that takes one to the base of Pyramid Peak goes through old mining cabins and areas for a historical tour./ P/ lake 
228/ CloudsAttackNV.jpg/ When Clouds Attack/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ This storm-front swallowed me whole while I walked the ridge up this little peak. It hung fairly still so that on one side, I could see for miles, and on the other, not even inches. I had to step very carefully, though the ridge was wider than many I have been on, and the clouds seemed not to move at all, which was interesting, and rare./ P/ storm 
229/ GreatBasinFall.jpg/ Foliage in the Great Basin/ Great Basin National Park, Nevada/ Some of the finest autumn foliage I have ever seen is out in the Nevada desert, deep in Great Basin National Park- free to enter. The drive out is long, and amenities are few, but that promises you star-filled skies and solitude./ P/ autumn 
230/ SunriseNVBorder.jpg/ Sunrise on the Border/ Nevada and Utah Border/ Low clouds hang over the sands of the desert where two states meet on a pretty, quiet Highway 50. I had to pull to the side of the road to savor this scene on my way to Cathedral Gorge./ L/ sunrise, winter, desert 
231/ CathGorge1.jpg/ A Pillar in the Sun/ Cathedral Gorge State Park, Nevada/ Amazing delicate sand and mud hoodoos from in the lonely Cathedral Gorge, changing often. The sky is an exclamation point of blue behind. The park is small but will be a delight to families with children or anyone out for a wild unique place./ L/ desert, rock 
232/ CathGorge2.jpg/ Hiking Through Hoodoos/ Cathedral Gorge State Park, Nevada/ Soft hoodoos at Cathedral Gorge are cold inside and fun to explore, but please tread carefully and avoid plants as the desert ecosystem is fragile and easy to scar./ L/ desert 
234/ InsideMudCave.jpg/ Looking Up in a Mud Siloh/ Cathedral Gorge State Park, Nevada/ The landscape often changes at Cathedral Gorge, and is a challenge to describe. Inside these "caves" and canyons, the air is very cold. Hoodoo mazes offer many chances to explore for the few that drive to the middle of nowhere./ P/ desert 
235/ CathGorge3.jpg/ Small White Peak/ Cathedral Gorge State Park, Nevada/ Colorful sands and spires glisten in the sun just off trail. Remember the desert is fragile./ L/ desert, rock 
236/ BachsOrgan.jpg/ Bach's Organ/ Cathedral Gorge State Park, Nevada/ The wind plays beautiful music through this spot that few ever hear of or see. Cathedral Gorge State Park is small but a wonderful place to pass a day./ P/ desert, rock 
237/ MudTowers.jpg/ Mud Towers/ Cathedral Gorge State Park, Nevada/ As a kid I used to form castles at the beach with wet handfuls of sand and gloop and mud, which never quite compared with these!/ P/ desert, rock 
238/ MudCaveUpY.jpg/ Y Are You Staring? Cathedral Gorge State Park, Nevada/ An intense light pattern is created at the top of this very narrow cave I squeezed into. This photo was captured looking straight up and I was pleased by the result as the darkness inside the cave made me doubtful of the result./ L/ desert 
239/ VOFTowers1.jpg/ Strange Towers Sniffing / Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ Let your imagination go wild if you make it to this state park near Las Vegas. The many wind-cut forms defy standard thoughts or description. This is near the charming campground, a great place to pass some nights./ L/ desert 
240/ VOFTowers2.jpg/ More Strange Towers Sitting Up/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ Heads of snakes, red rocks, reptilian stone, natural sphinxes, and a campground just feet from it all. The hiking is generally easy and there are several paved trails accessible to anyone at this state park just outside of the Las Vegas area./ L / desert 
241/ VOFEar.jpg/ The Desert is Listening/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ This one just looks like the great ear to the ground to me. Many windows line up behind. Valley of Fire State Park is a great contrast with the bustle of Las Vegas and is a must-see for me on any trip to the area./ L/ desert 
242/ VOFRidge.jpg/ SlickRock Ramp/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ Hiking up this ramp into the last of the daylight, I had a great little bit of exercise. Sunrise and sunset are certainly the ideal times to be out in the desert, at least for taking decent pictures. The bright sun and sky wash out these magnificent colors most of the day./ L/ desert, rock 
243/ VOFtriangle.jpg/ Triangle Affire/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ Purple foreground meets bright orange daylight in this small cave./ P/ desert 
244/ GCSunrise1.jpg/ Winter Sunrise at Grand Canyon/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ Early morning light catches distant valleys and a kiss of snow in the last week of February.  March brings green to the Grand Canyon, and thousands of visitors every day. The last week of February one might have privacy as well as the first hints of spring's beauty./ L/ desert, winter, canyon 
245/ GCredgreen.jpg/ Green and Red Vista/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ The lower elevations are enjoying spring below a ruby red sentinel, while the higher rim is still cold and asleep for winter./ L/ desert, canyon 
246/ GCKaibobTrail.jpg/ Down the Kaibob Trail/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ A view down one of three long trails into the heart of the Grand Canyon, which all meet at Phantom Ranch, offering cabins and tent camping, very popular and hard to get reservations for. The last week of February is almost spring, still chilly usually, but with a good chance of feeling like the canyon is your own./ L/ desert, path, canyon 
247/ GCbehindfalls.jpg/ Through the Falls/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ A tumble of water partly veils walls of the Grand Canyon behind, close to the Colorado River, deep down below the rim./ L/ desert, waterfall 
248/ GC2sprays.jpg/ Two Sprays/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ Two sprays of water tumble down from cliffs above in the Grand Canyon's depths with red walls behind. The waterfall is Ribbon Falls, a fantastic destination in a little secluded oasis, near to Phantom Ranch and the Colorado River./ P/ desert, waterfall 
249/ GCRibbonSide.jpg/ Ribbon Falls From Above/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ Below, Ribbon Falls plummets into and down a giant egg of moss- one of the more interesting waterfalls I have seen./ P/ waterfall, desert 
250/ GCRibbonUp.jpg/ Ribbon Falls From Below/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ A glance up remarkable, and unique Ribbon Falls, an oasis near Phantom Ranch in the heart of desert depths. A highly recommended destination for those making their way down into the Grand Canyon. It does require an overnight stay for all but the strongest hikers, however./ P/ waterfall, desert 
251/ DeerBiting.jpg/ An Itch You Have To Sratch/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ After 15 cautious minutes together, this deer relaxed and went about the day's business. Ever have an itch that just can't wait, ladies?/ L/ wildlife, deer 
252/ GCPanPt.jpg/ From Panorama Point/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ I think this is my favorite spot in the Grand Canyon, thus far. An excellent position for a sunset, with Indian Springs Campground just a short hike away on the Tonto Plateau. The Tonto Plateau is the middle layer of the Grand Canyon, so there are cliffs falling thousands of feet below, and rising thousands of feet above with scrub brush, and cacti and a few desert flowers at your feet./ P/ desert, summit 
253/ AZdesertredrise.jpg/ Red Desert Sunrise/ Superstition Mountains, Arizona/ I used to frequent the Superstitions before I owned a camera and many wonderful shots like this went un-captured. The area is known for hoodoos, and saguaro cacti, some quite huge and was once panned for gold./ L/ desert, sunrise 
254/ WheelerNeedle.jpg/ Wheeler's Needle with Cacti/ Superstition Mountains, Arizona/ What is sharper- the cacti or the peak behind? Climbers enjoy this mountain but there are no hike trails to its top, only around it. Summer is not the time to go see this one./ P/ desert 
255/ AZ4Peaks.jpg/ Four Peaks/ Arizona/ Once I hiked these peaks, before I owned a camera, driving 18 miles of wild 4X4 road with a Camry when I was too dumb to know better. This view will have to do, with a mix of flowers and cacti./ L/ desert, flower 
256/ AZTontoBridge.jpg/ Under Tonto Bridge/ Tonto Natural Bridge, Arizona/ I was enjoying the solitary splendor of this huge form until a group of missionaries came and decided bellowing and leaping into water on their day off from duty was the only thing to do. I suppose everyone should enjoy nature in their own way, as long as it does no damage. Fun is fun./ P/ desert 
257/ ThroughTontoArch.jpg/ Window of Shadow/ Tonto Natural Bridge, Arizona/ The sky seems farther away than ever through this window of darkness./ L/ 
258/ Sedona1.jpg/ Sedona Winter Sunrise/ Sedona, Arizona/ A brutally windy and cold morning in the famous red rock country was a welcome treat to me, as seen by this shocking sunrise. I jogged along the road, bundled up and shivering between stops to set up a photo./ L/ sunrise, winter, desert 
259/ SedonaPeaks.jpg/ Sedona Winter Peaks/ Sedona, Arizona/ Fabulous hiking through red rocks and cliffs was even more charming than usual with a fresh fall of contrasting snow keeping most in their beds. Sedona is extra charming in winter, in my opinion./ L/ desert, winter 
260/ Sedona2.jpg/ Red Desert Mountains/ Sedona, Arizona/ Cacti, red sands, a brilliant silver sky, and a jagged horizon make a pleasing full composition here from a relaxing hike./ L/ desert, rock 
261/ SedonaStump.jpg/ Shattered Stump in Sedona/ Sedona, Arizona/ Deep in a cold canyon, the red cliffs dusted with white snow tower over a stump of tree, shattered some way or other long ago. Perhaps lightning, or to gravity, after an onslaught by termites./ P/ winter, desert 
262/ AZRuins.jpg/ Ancient Ruins In the Painted Desert/ Sedona, Arizona/ Long before climate control and any modern comfort, people were eeking out a difficult life on the margins of the desert. Well at least they had privacy and plenty of elbow room./ L/ desert 
263/ AZPaintedDesert.jpg/ Painted Desert Splendid Sunset/ Painted Desert, Arizona/ After being washed-out most of a cloudless day, the Painted Desert became a spectacle of colors, as evidenced here. I had to settle for taking pictures. A hike for another season!/ L/ desert, sunset, sunburst 
264/ Antelope1.jpg/ Think Thin/ Antelope Canyon, Arizona/ Slot canyons are not for the claustrophobic, or those with "bigger bones". There are 2 Antelope Canyons- this is taken in the less-popular and more arduous one with metal stairways and some tougher terrain. I have been in both and prefer the Upper Canyon experience, personally./ P/ desert, slot canyon 
265/ AntelopeUp.jpg/ Antelope Canyon, Arizona/ A contrast of walls, orange and purple, with swirls of water and wind, a song of aeons, waiting for you to visit. Guided tours only, worth every penny, and you get flute music as a bonus./ P/ desert, slot canyon 
266/ Antelope2.jpg/ Think Thin Again/ Antelope Canyon, Arizona/ The high light of noon can barely creep through these slivered walls, some of the most beautiful narrows in the Southwest./ P/ desert, slot canyon 
267/ AntelopeArrow.jpg/ Come This Way/ Antelope Canyon, Arizona/ See the arrow pointing the way? Light forms behave like a personal spiritual journey in this canyon that was holy to the Natives and now is for thousands of tourists. Guided tours only. This photo will look best in 8” X 12” or 24” X 30” proportions. Cropping to other proportions without losing some the light arrow is difficult./ P/ desert, slot canyon, sunburst 
268/ AntelopeCoyote.jpg/ Spirit of Coyote, Shadow of Medicine Woman/ Upper Antelope Canyon, Arizona/ Can you spot the shadow on the right in the shape of a coyote's head, complete with ear, nose, and eye, waiting obediently at the hand of a glowing golden woman on the left, with a sweep of long hair? At her hip also on the left, some even pick out a rock that looks like a small boy./ P/ desert, slot canyon, rock 
269/ ZionTreeStump.jpg/ Horns of Wood/ Zion National Park, Utah/ A stump of tree shakes its head at me on a little scramble in the late afternoon. Harsh beauty abounds in the southern parts of Utah. This was a scramble, without trail, up some slick rock forms that interested me from the Mount Carmel Highway 9 through the Eastern sections of Zion National Park./ L/ desert 
270/ ZionPeaks1.jpg/ Found Horizon / Zion National Park, Utah/ This is one of my favorite spots in Zion National Park (so far), just off Hwy 9 on the east side of the park. Few marked trails tell you where to go, but go get lost and find treasures for yourself. Nearly every sandy wash will lead to something interesting, be it arch, vista, or scramble./ L/ desert, summit 
271/ ZionWallClimb.jpg/ Slab Scrambling in Zion/ Zion National Park, Utah/ One of many fun domes and pyramids to play on in Zion's east section, where established trails are few and far between. Keep momentum and its much safer than it appears. Do not try a slickrock route on any wet day or a day that threatens rain however, as what little grip one finds is then washed away completely./ L/ desert 
272/ ZionRedFlowers.jpg/ Red Desert Blossoms/ Zion National park, Utah/ Life finds a way, even when that means pushing through hard rock and finding a shady crevice to squeeze through. These little flowers were the only ones I saw on this particular spring day, exploring without trail./ L/ desert, flower 
273/ BuckskinGulch1.jpg/ World's Longest Slot/ Buckskin Gulch, Utah/ Twelve miles alternate between narrows a few feet thick and open sunny, sandy stretches, but the walls of Buckskin Gulch never cease to amaze, or shrink in stature, reaching hundreds of feet up into the sky./ P/ desert, slot canyon 
274/ BuckskinGulch2.jpg/ Head Towards the Light/ Buckskin Gulch, Utah/ Mud holes and icy water await hikers in Buckskin Gulch and demonstrate the flood danger of desert slot canyons. The effect for photography can be striking though. This canyon is typically travelled only in warmer parts of the year for the reason of these puddles./ L/ desert, slot canyon 
275/ BuckskinGulchUp1.jpg/ Wet Wall in Buckskin/ Buckskin Gulch, Utah/ Looking up into the distant light, shivering, despite the air outside the canyon being close to 100 F. Inside, I wanted layers. There was time for sweating on the way back to the car./ P/ desert, slot canyon 
276/ BuckskinGulch3.jpg/ More of Buckskin's Narrows/ Buckskin Gulch, Utah/ Out of hundreds of photos in this magnificent canyon, only a few will turn out, as the intense darkness of the walls and shadows overwhelm the soft orange grace of afternoon's angles. Most visitors go in the afternoon, so if you want solitude, start early and you can easily find it. You may not get so many memories for your walls, doing so, however./ P/ desert, slot canyon 
277/ BuckskinGulch4.jpg/ Midway Opening in Buckskin Gulch/ Buckskin Gulch, Utah/ Six miles into the world's longest slot canyon, there is a grand opening perfect for lunch. The walls spread apart and neon green trees provide a little shade under a suddenly warmer air. This is also where most casual and day hikers will turn around, if not sooner./ P/ desert, slot canyon 
278/ BuckskinGulchUp2.jpg/ Wet Wall in Buckskin 2/ Buckskin Gulch, Utah/ A second look at an impressive shining wall being cut steadily for centuries by a small trickle of water down its center- the only fresh water (not muddy) I found for the day- though only enough to wet the tongue. Pack the water you will want unless you are hiking all the way to the junction with the river./ P/ desert, slot canyon 
279/ DesertFlowersRed1.jpg/ Red Blossoms in the Desert/ Coyote Buttes, Utah/ Upon exiting famous Buckskin Gulch, I climbed out into the sun where a cliffy ramp caught my notice. I walked slickrock mounds like these for a while to warm up. A few flowers and a few flies were the only evidence of life. After not many minutes of being dry, I was already getting overheated and headed back into the shady slot walls./ P/ desert, flower 
280/ ZionFootSprain.jpg/ Over Zion Canyon Overlook/ Zion National Park, Utah/ There is a fun slickrock scramble route above the Zion Canyon Overlook. The best time to climb it is early in the morning when this great view sometimes glows red at first light. Be careful- I sprained my foot about 10 minutes after taking this picture moving too fast like Spiderman for the “benefit” of some young admirers below./ L/ desert 
281/ GrandWinterPan.jpg/ Winter in the Grand Canyon/ Grand Canyon, Arizona/ Below the Tonto Plateau, the air is warm enough by late February to melt snow and feed the green spring, while above on the high South rim, snow clings, and winter holds on tight./ W/ desert, winter, canyon 
282/ PuffBallZoom.jpg/ Zoom Of Perfect Ball of Seeds/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Just simple shot of a single perfect ball of seeds, somehow intact until the next breath of wind./ P/ flower 
283/ CloudSwirlBellPk.jpg/ Summit of Bighorn Peak/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ This summit, Bighorn Peak, or Bell's Peak, is rarely visited, dwarfed by nearby neighbor Lone Peak, and with no approach trails except difficult, hot, south facing options, all long. I made this ascent after several failed attempts, from a base camp at beautiful isolated Lake Hardy, generally only popular with fishermen./ L/ cloud, summit 
284/ AlpineFromBellPk.jpg/ Summit of Bighorn Peak 2/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ The town of Alpine sits charming before Utah Lake, taken from Bighorn Peak, or Bell's Peak, a satisfying scramble high over beautiful and isolated Lake Hardy./ L/ summit 
285/ GiantClaw.jpg/ Giant's Claw/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Taken near the summit of forgettable Chipman Peak, this is a rare angle to view the Pfeifferhorn, striking behind a unique rock from on a spring afternoon. Pfeifferhorn is remarkable from every angle and is one of the Wasatch's most targeted and most frequently summited peaks./ P/ summit, rock 
286/ SunsetBurstGrassTall.jpg/ Sunset Over Great Salt Lake With Grasses/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Another sunset snapped on huge Frances Peak, with a convenient 8 mile winding dirt road to the top. Antelope Island lays still below this sphere of brilliance. A great rest in a tent awaited, though the night was startlingly windy./ P/ sunset, sunburst, lake, summit 
287/ GoblinSepia3.jpg/ So Many Goblins/ Goblin Valley, Utah/ At noon, with no cloud in sight, and heat shimmering, I had little hopes for pictures on my trip to Goblin Valley, but a sepia stain produces an antiquated look that suits the desert well, I feel. Here are more goblins than even Bilbo Baggins could take!/ L/ desert, rock 
288/ MonarchFlowerZoom.jpg/ Sitting Down to Lunch/ Albuquerque Zoo, New Mexico/ This orange butterfly lands briefly for a little taste of nectar in the Butterfly Pavilion at the Albuquerque Zoo. I had a half dozen amazing captures on this visit, in a little under an hour, and was surprised by each, thinking when leaving the pavilion that the day had been a bust./ L/ butterfly, wildlife

290/ ButterflyZoom2.jpg/ Colorful Pose/ Albuquerque Zoo, New Mexico/ Among flowers, a colorful butterfly alights gracefully for a little meal. Many zoos are adding these butterfly houses now, which prove popular, especially with the kids. Butterflies may even land right on the hand or shoulder of some patient, quiet visitor./ P/ wildlife, butterfly 
291/ NMPeakWindow.jpg/ Natural Window/ New Mexico/ Through a shadowed leafy frame, a forested peak sits in late afternoon sunlight, near the top of the Sandia Peak tram. We had appetizers in the restaurant near the top of the tram, then headed back outside to watch a stunning desert sunset./ L/ summit 
292/ NMSunset1.jpg/ Sandia Peak Sunrise 1/ New Mexico/ Clouds break above a sunburst high on Sandia Peak in the cool desert night. Sunsets from the top of a mountain make the sky seem to stretch out to infinity./ P/ cloud, sunburst, sunset 
293/ NMSunset2.jpg/ Sandia Peak Sunrise 2/ New Mexico/ A textbook display of different cloud types segregate through the tall sky over the Southwest desert. Taken from Sandia Peak, near the top of the popular tram. Can you name each band of cloud?/ P/ cloud, sunset 
294/ ColoCliffWall.jpg/ Great Wall of Nature/ Colorado/ An interesting cliff band make a great natural barrier near where Natives once built their villages, centuries ago. This is a view from Mesa Verde National Park, known for cliff city ruins./ L/

298/ UTinversion2.jpg/ BeaUTAHful Inversion/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Below in the valley, an inversion of pollution haze hides all sign of life. From above, this sickly layer almost looks angelic and it made me feel I was atop the world, with everything below hidden by a veil./ L/ winter, summit 
299/ AntelopeFin.jpg/ Fin At The End of the World/ Antelope Island, Utah/ Antelope Island in Utah feels cut off from the rest of the world, lonely and stark in the middle of the Great Salt Lake, still and cold. Winter is my favorite time to visit the park, quiet, and especially beautiful, and without the bugs or sea stink of summer./ L/ winter, rock 
300/ AntelopeBuff.jpg/ Buffalo By the Shore/ Antelope Island, Utah/ This hefty fellow finds a good meal in the coarse desert grasses on Antelope Island, with the Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch Range behind. Don't miss the buffalo roundup every Halloween./ L/ wildlife, lake 
301/ BryceSunrise.jpg/ Kaleidoscope Skyline/ Bryce Canyon, Utah/ Cold winter sunrises are one of my favorite things down at Bryce Canyon where desert mesas and domes create silhouettes against wild striated patterns of brilliant color. The park is so charming in the early and late day that one wishes the cold mornings would never yield to sunlight./ L/ sunrise, desert 
302/ Zion2rimfalls.jpg/ Twin Cascades Over the Rim/ Zion National Park, Utah/ Two thin falls flow down from the Middle Emerald Pool along one of the park's most popular trails, with just the first few hints of spring coming out./ L/ desert, waterfall 
303/ CalfCreekSide.jpg/ Calf Creek Pool/ Escalante, Utah/ There are few waterfalls in Utah more dramatic or dynamic than Calf Creek Falls in the Escalante desert, seen here from the side with afternoon light spotlighting a grove of trees. Lunchtime will see this pool fill with splashing families, but the rest of the day is not too crowded usually. The best light is had around noon when the waterfall is lit bright and the colors of the walls really come out./ L/ waterfall, desert 
304/ CalfCreekFront.jpg/ Calf Creek Classic/ Escalante, Utah/ The familiar full-frontal view of Calf Creek Falls, an easy 3 mile hike from the road. The hardest part of the day is finding a place to park! Even in the heat of summer, the pool will chill you to the bone./ P/ waterfall, desert 
305/ CalfCreekBurst.jpg/ Green and Orange Desert Burst/ Escalante, Utah/ Orange rocks with vibrant brush tower over the trail to Calf Creek and its inimitable falls. The trail is an easy, level 3 miles. Often, the hardest part of the day is finding parking!/ P/ desert, sunburst 
306/ WarpSpeed.jpg/ Warp Speed Ahead/ Escalante, Utah/ The brilliant narrows of Red Breaks stretch for miles with mild, but interesting, climbing moves interspersed around boulders and other obstacles./ P/ slot, desert, rock 
307/ IceCreamDome.jpg/ Ice Cream Dome/ Escalante, Utah/ Through the narrows of Red Breaks, amazing forms pile atop one another, changing every few steps, and showing a variety of rock most never suspect or know. This one makes me think of a swirled ice cream cone for some reason./ P/ desert, rock 
308/ RedBreaksGround.jpg/ Scoured Ground/ Escalante, Utah/ At the end of the Red Breaks narrows, the fun has hardly begun as the desert opens up with surprises at every step. Some continue on to a unique huge formation called “The Cosmic Ashtray”, but be knowledgeable with map and compass, or very trusting of your GPS before straying too far into the desert./ P/ desert, rock 
309/ BoxLakeReflect2.jpg/ Box Lake Reflected/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Box Lake, still and quiet, reserved for fishing, lies here at sunrise with a perfect reflection. I had this view to myself, but for a few deer. I enjoyed the pictures and scenery so much I spent the night in the campground so I could get multiple shoots in. Well worth it!/ P/ sunrise, reflection, lake 
310/ DeerHidingGreen.jpg/ Where's Waldo/  Deer Version/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ This little lady bolted from me after we came within 5 feet of each other, both moving silently. She watched me from here for a good while, hoping I could not spot her, after running to what felt like a safe distance. I did a little light climbing for exercise between a few snapshots./ L/ wildlife, deer 
311/ JeffDeseret.jpg/ Solitary Figure At the Top of the World/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A friend crosses this sub-peak in the Deseret Range of Utah, on a marvelous blue day with slow drifting clouds overhead. We completed an 8 mile loop hike up and over Deseret Peak. This is a great hike but one that pine beetles are ravaging. Each time I go out to the Deseret Range, more pine trees are downed or turning brown from the bottom up./ L/ 
312/ DeseretFamous1.jpg/ Deseret Peak with Flowers/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A long loop goes up and around this peak, taking in the route from this vantage before descending steeply. What a magnificent mountain! This is the best lookout point and I have never made it here for a sunrise, though I simply must one day./ L/ flower

314/ HolbrookSnowArch2.jpg/ Cold Powdery Trail/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Bent trees fight not only gravity here, but fresh snow as well, creating a charming effect, so long as one's jacket is thick./ P/ winter, path 
315/ StLousIce2.jpg/ St Louis Falls Frozen Ver 2/ Starved Rock State Park, Illinois/ Despite being ill, I hiked out on a short visit to Illinois from the lodge. This was my destination, and the sight was worth the effort surely, though I did have to move slow and stop often for queasiness./ P/ waterfall, winter, icefall 
316/ CathGorgeLotsPk.jpg/ Lot's Wife Peak/ Cathedral Gorge State Park, Nevada/ This shining white jagged peak reminded me of the story of Lot's wife being turned to salt. The air was so clear that it hurt bare eyes. This photograph can be paired with a white matte or frame to intensify the effect of the bright colors, or muted with dark frames if that proves too bold. I have tried both, and it really depends on the room and neighboring photographs./ P/ desert 
317/ ShadowDeathNegTxt.jpg/ Valley of the Shadow of Death With Scripture/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ This negative of my own shadow projected below me always reminds me of the popular psalm 23, printed here on the photo. A good spiritual print or card./ L/ text, shadow, action
318/ ShadowDeathNeg.jpg/ Valley of the Shadow of Death/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ A negative print of my own shadow projected out onto an un-real desert far below the ridge I walked at sunset. An intense effect. This is the option without text./ L/ shadow, action
319/ ShadowLogo.jpg/ Shadow Hiker Stepping Up/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ Late in the afternoon I realized as I walked a ridge that my shadow was following me below on a wild desert landscape. At a convenient point, I modeled and captured the moment. My favorite portrait, which is probably obvious, as I use it for my logo./ L/ desert, shadow, action 
320/ ShadowLogoSep.jpg/ Shadow Hiker Stepping Up in Sepia/ Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada/ A sepia stain of my favorite portrait, used as my company logo. I cut a handsome shadow I think, though the landscape overshadows me./ L/ shadow, action, desert 
321/ 4Deer.jpg/ Ladies Brunch/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ It took some time, but these deer tolerated my attention from across a hop of water after a 15 minute probation period. One munched away, more trusting or naïve than the rest. I met this group up a small side canyon near Phantom Ranch, exploring off trail./ L/ wildlife, deer 
322/ AlligatorTree.jpg/ Alligator Tree/ Arizona/ An old tree with scaley skin that caught my attention, its many limbs looking like rows of teeth to me, a gaping sagging jaw./ P/ 
323/ MossCave.jpg/ Waterfall Cave/ Teton Natural Bridge, Arizona/ Not what I expected when I saw "Waterfall Cave" on the map, but this mossy flow was beautiful and unique anyway, and better than my expectations. This is one of my favorite pictures from a 2012 trip to Arizona, in fact, and I always have it up on my walls somewhere./ P/ waterfall 
324/ SedonaPeaks2.jpg/ Sedona Country in Winter/ Sedona, Arizona/ A brutal morning in the desert was marvelous to behold, and quickly melted, just a tease before a warmer afternoon. I went through several layers this day./ L/ winter, desert 
325/ AntelopeUpCrack.jpg/ Crack in the Sky/ Antelope Canyon, Arizona/ A shot straight up out of the Upper Antelope Canyon didn't quite turn out, with some camera glare, but still makes a great shot, I feel. I often send it as a card, and sometimes frame it for the wall in bigger shots./ L/ desert, slot canyon, sunburst, rock 
326/ AntelopeWindow.jpg/ Window of Wind/ Antelope Canyon, Arizona/ Wind and water carve out gentle patterns and sculptures in this most famous of slot canyons, near the city of Page. Guided tours only. Call ahead if you are going in the busy summer months./ L/ desert, slot canyon, rock 
327/ AntelopeHawk.jpg/ Hawk Watching, Waiting/ Antelope Canyon, Arizona/ Some rocks in this magical slot canyon take on the shape of animals with a little imagination, and here I saw a huge hawk, hunkered down and waiting./ P/ desert, slot canyon, rock 
328/ ProvoRiverWinter.jpg/ Provo River Parkway/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ This bicycle path is one of my favorite places to cross-country ski, right after a fresh storm. Snow will not sit long. Just off the road one seems to experience deep mountain seclusion during the winter. A very different feel than in any other season./ L/ winter, path 
329/ BridalVeilWinter.jpg/ Cold Bride/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ Bridal Veil Falls, visible from a nearby road, looks even prettier in a cold winter, I think. Here fresh snow frames the falls well./ P/ winter, waterfall 
330/ TulipExplode.jpg/ An Explosion of Tulips/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ The Tulip Festival always pleases at Thanksgiving Point. Admission is worth sights like this./ P/ flower, tulip
331/ DevCastleSummits.jpg/ The Devil's Castle Conquered/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A popular rugged peak in Utah is home to many black and sinister turrets and towers, each requiring a few moves above plenty of air. There are also technical climbing routes for teams with the proper gear. None of the summits is quite so gentle as a walk./ P/ summit 
332/ ButterflyPouncePan.jpg/ Butterfly Pouncing Panorama/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ I had only enough time for one shot, and it came out perfectly, as this monarch balances, spreads wings, and takes off among flowers in the wild. This panorama can be cropped beautifully to any of the sizes available./ W/ butterfly, flower, wildlife, panorama 
333/ GrandHorsesPan.jpg/ Horses On the Kaibob/ Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona/ Heading down into the canyon, I stopped and snapped pictures of a group on horseback, who took pictures of me, thinking someone funny to use his own legs to go so far. Taken on the Tonto Plateau, descending the South Kaibob Trail on my way to Phantom Ranch for an overnight sleeping bag stay./ W/ desert, wildlife, panorama, canyon 
334/ MeadowPath.jpg/ Path through a Perfect Meadow/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ A friend of mine described this meadow as "meadowy" which is either the worst possible description, or the best. I suppose it is apt either way as this is a quintessential high mountain meadow with a trail./ L/ flower, path 
335/ VAFalls1.jpg/ Diamond Gush/ Virginia/ Friends took me to this waterfall on my only visit to Virginia. It sparkled like a flow of diamond under intense sun, though the day was cool./ L/ waterfall, forest 
336/ VAFalls2.jpg/ In A Cascade/ Virginia/ Footing here was not ideal and perhaps I should not have been standing where I was, but I wanted this view./ L/ waterfall 
337/ VAFalls3.jpg/ Crystal Gush/ Virginia/ Another Virginia waterfall, snapped on my only visit. A pretty country, and green in spring, to be sure. After a cool hike, we visited Amish farms and shoppes./ L/ waterfall 
338/ ZionFallsSunburst.jpg/ Emerald Falls/ Zion National Park, Utah/ The trail to the Emerald Pools, central to Zion Canyon, passes right under this waterfall, a cool treat in summer./ P/ waterfall, sunburst 
339/ BryceSandy.jpg/ Sandy Wash In Bryce Canyon/ Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah/ There are small little secrets along the Hwy 12 that are just outside of Bryce Canyon proper, where crowds won't follow and unique visions can be had. This sandy wash was one, with a pleasing view at its end. I discovered it just pulling into a small turnout to see if anything were there./ P/ desert, canyon 
340/ BryceOverhead.jpg/ Sunrise Point/ Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah/ A classic view staked out early in a bitterly cold morning with many other photographers. Bryce Canyon is a sunset and sunrise park, washed out mid-day./ L/ desert, canyon 
341/ TulipYelPurp.jpg/ Yellow and Purple Tulips/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ Tulips of every color wait the visitor to Thanksgiving Point for the Tulips Festival. It may not compare with Holland, but the price is better! And having never been to Holland, I do not really know the difference./ P/ flower , tulip
342/ TulipeSuperBright.jpg/ Bright Flowers, Bright Day/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ To really capture flowers, I find I have to get low to the ground. Height doesn't help, surely./ P/ flower , tulip
343/ TulipZoomSun.jpg/ Single Tulip In Grace/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ A soft effect from a microzoom, on this perfect lonely red tulip at the Tulip Festival, afire from late afternoon sun./ L/ flower , tulip
344/ HyacinthWhite.jpg/ Hyacinth in Grace/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ A halo upon hyacinths perfectly white brings out pure thoughts at the Tulip Festival./ L/ flower 
345/ AppleTulips.jpg/ Apple-Speckled Tulips/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ Frilly petals and variety of design once busted Holland's economy during the wind trade, when tulip mania for gems like these drove bulb prices up astronomically. Many great houses were mortgaged, and families were ruined, all in the name of gardening. A better plan is to pay a few bucks and go walk the well-tended garden at Thanksgiving Point./ L/ flower , tulip
346/ HugeFallsWA.jpg/ Mighty Pair/ North Cascades, Washington/ Two huge, powerful froths plummet down far below, witnessed from damp rocks on a narrow ledge which was only a little wet from spray./ P/ waterfall , Pacific Northwest
347/ ArtistStorms.jpg/ Artist Point Storms/ North Cascades, Washington/ Mount Shukskan is besieged by heavy stormclouds, seen from Artist Point close to sundown. I camped near the end of the road parking lot, a cold night, but one which left me plenty of time to explore late evening and all the next day./ L/ storm, winter, summit , Pacific Northwest
348/ PicketsZoom.jpg/ Southern Pickets Zoom/ North Cascades, Washington/ The most ferocious range in the continental United States bares its teeth here on a solid blue backdrop, rare without storms. I will make it into the jaws of these mountains one summer. They are certainly on the list, though brutal or so I read./ L/ Pacific Northwest
349/ PicketsFar.jpg/ Southern Pickets From Trapper/ North Cascades, Washington/ The Southern Picket Range looms and tempts from near the summit of Trapper Peak. What makes the Pickets so challenging is that this is approximately as close as one can get by well-maintained trails./ L/ 
350/ Johannesburg.jpg/ Wall of Melting Glaciers/ North Cascades, Washington/ Heading up into the Cascades, this view of "The Black Demon" Mount Johannesburg inspires me for a future return. The only place I have seen walls and glacier melt falls like this elsewhere is Glacier National Park in Montana./ L/ Pacific Northwest
351/ Johan1.jpg/ Johannesburg Area 1/ North Cascades, Washington/ Heading up to camp near the Sahale Glacier, the views keep getting better and better through fields of flowers, with peaks all around. What a stunning hike and a special place to go and spend a night!/ L/ Pacific Northwest
352/ SahalePlusLake.jpg/ Mount Sahale with Lake Below/ North Cascades, Washington/ There is a life-changing campground near the top of this mountain, just a long, but easy hike. Above camp, summits await climbers./ L/ lake , Pacific Northwest
353/ ForbiddenFlowers.jpg/ Forbidden Flowers/ North Cascades, Washington/ Forbidden Peak squats in the distance beyond this meadow of flowers. Marmots popped their heads out every few minutes but I did not get a good capture of one as they quickly dropped down again, before I could zoom and frame them./ L/ flower , Pacific Northwest
354/ SahaleLakeBelow.jpg/ Nearing Sahale Campground/ North Cascades, Washington/ This photo looks back down to Johannesburg and the Sahale Arm, from near the trail's end, where the Sahale glacier sits. There is a truly beautiful campground up in the wind right on the glacier, with a stunning view at sunset and sunrise, or hundreds of peaks. If you rise early enough and are hearty, Sahale Peak's summit opens the view into a 360 degree wonder./ L/ lake , Pacific Northwest
355/ SahaleGoat.jpg/ Scout Raider/ North Cascades, Washington/ This goat circled the campground at dusk, "casing" the joint for the herd, who returned later in the night for raids. My food was secure, so I had no visitors, but I heard some less-experienced campers without bear-canisters throwing rocks, yelling, and doing battle./ L/ wildlife, goat , Pacific Northwest
356/ SahaleSunrise2.jpg/ Sunrise on Mount Sahale/ North Cascades, Washington/ An early start got me this view from the summit of Mount Sahale, with my gear and camp just below on the glacier. Plenty of time left in the day to climb other peaks, of which I availed myself./ L/ sunrise, summit , Pacific Northwest
357/ ClimbBoston.jpg/ Climbing Boston Peak/ North Cascades, Washington/ I had read this peak was 3rd class, meaning just an easy scramble, but found myself quickly meeting tougher vertical stuff than expected. Still, good fun, and I walked away. I still wonder when reading reports of this mountain if I just missed an obvious stroll up the peak, the way others talk. But my route passed several slings used for rappelling down, and without any rope at all, I was plenty engaged./ L/ Pacific Northwest
358/ Johan2.jpg/ Trail Through Johannesburg/ North Cascades, Washington/ Johannesburg Mountain looms behind this trail cut through meadows in the Cascade peaks. I was leaving the area this day unfortunately, because there are few spots in America so beautiful and so worth loitering in./ L/ path, flower , Pacific Northwest
359/ EZFlowers.jpg/ Easy Pass Flowers/ North Cascades, Washington/ Popular Easy Pass is home to great fields of flowers. I went out to photograph them on a "rest" day between climbs. Trouble was, I had to go up and over the pass and start descending steep switchbacks before reaching the flowers I sought, so I wound up burning up my thighs pretty thoroughly./ P/ flower , Pacific Northwest
360/ BeachMounds.jpg/ Beach Mounds/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ A cold beach hid several starfish and tidepools for me with these impressive features rising out of the water./ L/ beach , Pacific Northwest
361/ StarfishCrash.jpg/ Starfish Crash/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ Between rushing waves, I manage to capture a couple of starfish, clinging on for dear life. Hey its a living I guess./ L/ beach, wildlife , Pacific Northwest
362/ HohRain1.jpg/ Hoh Rainforest Trees/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ A surprisingly sunny day (or least, hour) in the Hoh Rainforest. This beautiful trail goes 17 miles and is used as the approach to Mount Olympus by mountaineers./ P/ forest , Pacific Northwest
363/ StarfishPile.jpg/ Pile Up Guys/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ So many starfish, plump and healthy, showing each other some love./ L/ beach, wildlife , Pacific Northwest
364/ NeonDinerStarfish.jpg/ Neon Diner/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ Starfish and urchins cluster together in what reminded me of a Fifties Diner for some reason- perhaps the clash of garish colors./ L/ beach, wildlife , Pacific Northwest
365/ PingoraCloudHide.jpg/ Pingora's Buzz Cut/ Wind River Mountains, Wyoming/ Famous Pingora Peak, guardian of the Cirque of Towers is clipped here, impairing my first view, but making me feel as though I were atop the world. I got very wet this day a couple of different times, but warmed up the next day hiking in the sun./ P/ storm 
366/ WolfsheadStorm.jpg/ Wolf's Head Brooding/ Wind River Mountains, Wyoming/ Wolf's Head Mountain huddles under an approaching storm that would make me very wet and cold, far above my camp. An ominous view. I knew better but did not want to pass the whole afternoon in dozing, waiting out the weather./ L/ storm , summit
367/ WYLedgeWalk.jpg/ Ledge Walk up WatchTower/ Wind River Mountains, Wyoming/ Wasy WatchTower Peak has options for more adventure, such as this little ledgewalk with little below./ P/ summit
368/ WYGetWet.jpg/ I Will Be Wet/ Wind River Mountains, Wyoming/ My last picture for the day before heading down, very wet and cold. Slept inside a very small cave, too low to sit up in, to keep dry and out of wind, as I packed no tent. I eventually had to just hike myself warm, starting in cold, wet boots and clothing the next morning after a good long slumber./ L/ storm 
369/ OverhangTowerFlowers.jpg/ Overhanging Flowers/ Wind River Mountains, Wyoming/ One resilient bunch of flowers thrive past summer's end on steep terrain as I head up for a solo run of Overhanging Tower. The climb was not so difficult as getting up the steep fields of scree without kicking rockslides down on flowers like these./ P/ flower, rock 
370/ OverhangTowerRocks.jpg/ Overhanging Tower Rocks/ Wind River Mountains, Wyoming/ Jags and false summits on the way to Overhanging Tower high in the Wind River mountains, near Cirque of the Towers. I warmed up for the morning by playing on little forms like these, just to get blood flowing./ L/ rock 
371/ FlameFalls.jpg/ Flaming Gusher/ Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming/ One of the few memories I kept from a crowded, annoying trip to the first of all America's national parks. I'm a wilderness boy, I have found, not a boardwalk with hundreds of others in front and behind kind of guy. But Yellowstone is a great experience for many./ L/ waterfall 
372/ FountainFlower.jpg/ Fountain with Flowers/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ Looking up the long stepped fountain in the gardens that hold the Tulip Festival./ L/ flower , tulip

375/ 3PinkTulip.jpg/ Three Pink Bulbs/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ Three perfect tulip bulbs stretch in the sun./ P/ flower , tulip
376/ FountainDown.jpg/ Looking Down The Fountain/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ Thanksgiving Gardens, home to the Tulip Festival are home to one grand stepped fountain./ P/ flower , tulip

379/ 4RWTulips.jpg/ Collage of Flowers/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ The Tulip Festival in Utah may not be quite as stunning as Holland's, but it is still a wonderful place to view many great flowers. And if you do not have a trip to Holland coming up, why complain about this alternative?/ L/ flower , tulip
380/ MoreRWTulips.jpg/ Tulips in the Sun/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ The Tulip Festival in Utah is a wonderful place to view many great flowers./ L/ flower , tulip
381/ 3RWTulips.jpg/ Three Amigos/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ The Tulip Festival in Utah may not be quite as stunning as Holland's, but it is still a wonderful place to view many great flowers. This was one of my favorite shots from a recent trip./ L/ flower , tulip
382/ 3RWTulipsRow.jpg/ Three Tulips in a Row/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ Rare tulips once blew up Holland's economy during the wind trade, when tulip mania for gems like these drove bulb prices up astronomically. Many great houses were mortgaged, and families were ruined, all in the name of gardening. A better plan is to pay a few bucks and go walk the well-tended garden at Thanksgiving Point./ P/ flower tulip

385/ TulipsAllT.jpg/ TuliPerfection/ Thanksgiving Point, Utah/ This is the best picture of tulips I have ever seen, and I did not take it. My good friend captured this one and the sales from this picture go to her. Its too perfect not to share!/ L/ flower, tulip
386/ ORHorsetailFalls.jpg/ HorseTail Falls/ Columbia Gorge, Oregon/ Several great waterfalls are clustered around Multnomah Falls in the Columbia Gorge, just miles from Portland./ P/ waterfall , Pacific Northwest
387/ ORBehindFalls.jpg/ Behind a Waterfall/ Columbia Gorge, Oregon/ Several great waterfalls are clustered around Multnomah Falls in the Columbia Gorge, just miles from Portland. One charm of the area is being able to walk underneath and behind waterfalls for views like this one./ L/ waterfall , Pacific Northwest
388/ ORBehindFalls2.jpg/ Behind a Waterfall Tall/ Columbia Gorge, Oregon/ Several great waterfalls are clustered around Multnomah Falls in the Columbia Gorge, just miles from Portland. Several falls are visible from paved trails or just off the road, so there is access for everyone, even those with limited mobility./ P/ waterfall , Pacific Northwest
389/ OneontaFalls.jpg/ Oneonta Falls/ Columbia Gorge, Oregon/ Several great waterfalls are clustered around Multnomah Falls in the Columbia Gorge, just miles from Portland, including this one, which requires a cold wade up Oneonta Creek. For that reason, the spot is best visited during summer months, though I have done it in May without a wet suit as well. Very few would like to share that experience however, I am confident!/ P/ waterfall , Pacific Northwest
390/ WACreekCross.jpg/ Creek Crossing/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ Carefully step across flows like this when hiking the Sol Duc forest. I met another party having lunch near this fresh little cascade, collecting water. The day was otherwise a solitary one until the campground near Apple Pass filled up and got social./ P/ waterfall ,Pacific Northwest 
391/ KingofSunset.jpg/ King of Sunset/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ One of my last shots of the day, taken from inside my sleeping bag came out splendid, with a silhouette of this buck, who was unaware of me, under a shady tree in a camouflage sleeping bag./ L/ sunset, wildlife, deer , Pacific Northwest
392/ SecretGardenBear.jpg/ Bear in the Secret Garden/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ This bear ran away from me when I made noise to announce myself. That helped my ego plenty, to be sure. This was my first ever bear sighting in the wild, though I would meet 2 more that evening./ P/ wildlife, flower , Pacific Northwest
393/ SecretGardenSunset.jpg/ Sunset From the Catwalk/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ Sunset near the Catwalk, a few miles gentle walk from charming Heart Lake. This was my favorite spot on a loop hike through the Sol Duc section of the park./ P/ sunset, flower , Pacific Northwest
394/ BrothersIceCave.jpg/ Ice Cave on the Brothers/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ Playing on a huge mountain known as "The Brothers", I cooled off in a pair of these melt caves, icy inside. A lady goat came to join me, and then followed me for miles. They know where to chill their bodies on hot days also./ P/ Pacific Northwest
395/ BrothersGoat.jpg/ Goat Girlfriend/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ This mountain goat followed me for more than 3 miles while descending "The Brothers". I guess I smelled better than I thought, or my beard was a little too thick after all. At least I know not all ladies are immune to my charms./ L/ wildlife, goat , Pacific Northwest
396/ FlowersMtJackson.jpg/ Flowers Before Mount Jackson/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ 10,000 ft Mount Jackson reminds of the Native name for this area, "The Land of Shining Mountains", in late afternoon. This was taken near the end of the trail to the foot of Jackson Glacier. From here I travelled cross country the rest of afternoon to Almost-A-Dog Pass a rugged trip./ P/ flower 
397/ GNPHalfwayLakes.jpg/ Reaching Halfway Lakes/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A brutal crossing of the Blackfoot Glacier and Valley was made better when I stumbled upon these "Halfway Lakes" and collected cool fresh water. I had not studied the map too closely, and so was surprised by these lakes. They have no official name, forming only in recent years as the glacier has begun receding distinctly./ L/ lake 
398/ GNPHalfwayLakes2.jpg/ Tumbling Water on the Edge of the World/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Near "Halfway Lakes", which have no official name, I walked toward the edge of the abyss with mountains far away. I called this spot “Halfway Lakes” because they sit about halfway between Jackson Glacier Trail's end and Almost-A-Dog Pass./ L/ waterfall 
399/ GNPLoganPkPlusRock.jpg/ Glacier Scars/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Logan Peak stands proud behind this tatooed rock cut by glaciers over centuries. The bright side to receding glaciers is the chance to study the rocks they leave behind./ P/ rock 
400/ GNPWallofFalls1.jpg/ Wall of Waterfalls/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Glacier melt cascades down with Logan Peak behind, near dusk. There were walls of waterfalls all around me as I crossed the Blackfoot Glacier in early summer, an arduous but truly memorable trip./ L/ waterfall 
401/ GNPJacksonGunsightSet.jpg/ Sunset over Mount Jackson and Gunsight Peak/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Taken near where I bedded down for the night, setting a secure camp against bears, far from any trail or any other human on a cold and damp night. I have passed many such lonely nights in GNP, happy and rejoicing in my own strength./ L/ sunset

404/ MtLogan1.jpg/ Summit of Mount Logan 1/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ One of the more remote peaks in the entire Glacier Park here stretches out to the sinking ship of a nearby summit. A sweeping view between threatening clouds. Weather changes in this park very quickly and staying dry has more to do with luck or caution than reading clouds, even for those experienced with mountain weather./ L/ storm, summit 
405/ LoganSummit2.jpg/ Blackfoot Mountain Sunsplotches/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Taken from remote Logan Peak, miles from a trail, even more remote peaks stretch out into the distance, covered with snow. Logan Peak is one of the parks' more difficult climbs- not for the challenge of the summit but of the approach. After miles on trail, one must cross miles off trail, across glacier terrain, steep and wild, then follow goat trails to the summit block. From there a mild scramble up cracks and through openings yields some of the best views in Montana./ L/ summit 
406/ MtLogan2.jpg/ Summit of Mount Logan 2/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ One of the more remote peaks in the entire Glacier Park here stretches out to the sinking ship of a nearby summit. A sweeping view between threatening clouds. There are many charming names for the many peaks in the park, though many are unnamed as well./ L/ storm, summit 
407/ GNPCutbank1.jpg/ Clouds Over Cutbank/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Storms swirl from Almost-A-Dog Mountain, down into the Cutbank area and peaks, peeking out through windows in the clouds. The weather cleared in the afternoon some, but it is a rare day that one can hike through GNP without some threat of storms./ L/ storm, summit 
408/ HalfwayLakesAboveBurst.jpg/ Halfway Lakes Sunburst/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Glittering light over Mount Jackson and Gunsight Peak in late afternoon, with the Halfway Lakes distant below, my home for the night. I reached the lakes just before sundown, with no time to eat as raindrops began to fall. When I got up the next day, the world was unrecognizable, with heavy silver fog suffocating everything./ L/ sunburst, cloud, summit 
409/ GNPWallofFalls2.jpg/ Big Wall of Waterfalls/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Too many waterfalls to count cascade down from melting glaciers near Logan Peak and the Blackfoot Glacier./ P/ waterfall 
410/ GunsightLake1.jpg/ Gunsight Lake/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ One of the most popular lakes in the park is fed by glaciers high above, its waters changing colors from hour to hour and day to day. This lake is visited by thousands every year, most to camp. Some ascend Gunsight Peak's summits high above for a remarkable view./ L/ lake 
411/ Waterton1.jpg/ Town of Waterton/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ From Bear's Hump summit, the town of Waterton sits at the head of Waterton Lake, just inside the boundary of Canada./ P/ lake, summit 
412/ GNPBoltFalls.jpg/ Francis Falls/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ This bolt of water comes down from a valley that seems remote enough to still hold dinosaurs, a shelf where anything is possible. I made some friends this evening, and we passed the hours of a storm joking, wet and cold, but enjoying the mountains./ P/ waterfall 
413/ GNPLakeFrancis.jpg/ Alpen Glow From Lake Francis/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A torrential downpour let up for a little while for friends and I to enjoy this alpen glow over Mount Cleveland and other peaks. The next morning was gloriously sunny, allowing us time to dry our gear and clothes. Then the bugs came out, of course./ L/ sunset, lake 
414/ GNPRainbowWall.jpg/ Rainbow Waterfall/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ This waterfall high on cliff walls caught just the right light to show the colors of the rainbow./ L/ waterfall 
415/ GNPBeargrass3.jpg/ Bear Grass and Hole in the Wall/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Hole in the Wall Cirque and Boulder Peak rise high into the sky behind these three white beargrass blossoms. By afternoon, I was looking down from Boulder Peak's summit, none too eager to retrace my steps. It was certainly worth the effort, however./ L/ flower 
416/ HoleInWall.jpg/ Hole in The Wall Cirque/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ One of the most stunning locales in all of Glacier's vast park is this Hole in the Wall Cirque, with a trail along its flank to the summit of Boulder Peak. The season to visit is very short, but months each year. This is a must for any hiking enthusiast though, and with crampons, ice axe, and the know-how to use them, solitude can be had early in the summer./ L/ waterfall 
417/ GNPMeltFalls1.jpg/ Melt Falls Near Boulder Peak/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ The trail to Boulder Pass and Peak can be treacherous too early in the year, and caution must be taken. But lonely beauty awaits in early summer. The footing is easy and lined with flowers by August when the campgrounds are open to anyone with strong legs and lungs./ P/ waterfall 
418/ GNPPocketLake.jpg/ Pocket Lake Frozen/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ I had hoped to catch this beautiful enclosed lake with big icerbergs floating, but very little water is visible, and the surface resembles a snowfield. Oh well. A great day anyhow and I still think this picture came out well./ L/ lake, summit, winter 
419/ GNPThunderbirdFlowers.jpg/ Thunderbird with Flowers/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ From the Hole in the Wall Trail, Thunderbird Mountain looks like what a mountain should. One of my favorite peaks in America, and one I summited next day after some struggles and several years of waiting. Only a few parties each year make it to the summit of Thunderbird Mountain. The route is circuitous and involved, to say the least./ P/ flower 
420/ GNPMeltFalls2.jpg/ Melt Falls Below Custer Peak/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ More glacier runoff crosses the path making footing treacherous on thin slopes with thousands of feet of air below. At least I did not want for water at any time on this trip./ P/ waterfall 
421/ KinnerlyFlowers.jpg/ Mt Kintla with Flowers/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ On the shoulder of Thunderbird Mountain, just before the final summit push, these little flowers caught my eye with fantastic big peaks behind. The two highest peaks visible here are among the most remote and difficult to climb in all of GNP. One summer, with a strong team, I make it to the top of them./ L/ flower, summit 
422/ ThunderbirdGlacier.jpg/ Greetings from the Thunderbird Glacier/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Watch your step. One slip could be fatal, though with care, no real danger exists in crossing this soft, stable snow on the way up Thunderbird Peak. On my descent, my footsteps had melted, and having not marked where I broke through a cliff band to reach this glacier, I had a time of it finding my way back down!/ L/ 
423/ GNPKootenaiLake.jpg/ Kootenai Lakes/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A great spot to catch moose, I rested up here for a few days after getting trenchfoot thanks to days on glaciers with heavy rain. There are worse places to mend. Next time I need a fishing pole. Day hikers from a nearby boat launch stopped in every few hours, so I met plenty of company./ L/ lake 
424/ GNPDomino1.jpg/ Domino Crackes Traverse/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ An early view from a route I may have pioneered up Mount Siyeh. Several established scrambles and climbs exist, but my way was very fun. Full details are on my summitpost.org page./ L/ 
425/ SiyehWall1.jpg/ Siyeh Summit Wall/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ One of America's greatest walls drops straight down far below me as I top out on a route that becomes a walk from here on out. To this point there was a little easy scrambling. Some strong climbers come straight up this vertical wall for sport./ P/ summit 
426/ CrackerLakeBelow.jpg/ Cracker Lake Below/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ This glacier-fed lake of wild hue took its name from an absurd story of early miners and their lost snack that stuck forever. That is a 4,000 ft drop straight down. A campground sits right by the lake./ P/ lake, summit 
427/ SiyehDivingBoard.jpg/ Siyeh Diving Board/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A great spot to make a base-jump, if such things were not illegal in GNP. An airy spot for a pause and a lunch anyway, if you hold your sandwich tight in the wind and do not lean too far over during a big gust!/ P/ summit 
428/ SiyehSummit1.jpg/ Siyeh Summit View of Gould/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Mount Gould, impressive from every angle, is in the mid-ground here, behind the narrow slash of a wall connecting Siyeh to Allen Mountain, with many peaks behind in a great "sea" of summits. This view from Mount Siyeh, central to the GNP is among my very favorite from near 30 peaks I've climbed in the park./ L/ summit 
429/ Beargrass2.jpg/ Beargrass Jewel/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A sparkling treasure of a blossom waits for a hungry bear or deer to come along, a treat for hikers in meantime./ P/ flower

431/ PtarmiganGoat1.jpg/ Just Around the Corner/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ The Ptarmigan Goat Trail's narrow thread becomes fainter around this shoulder, with Mount Merritt and its ramp of glacier behind across a valley. I took this little corner trail to scout conditions for an ascent of Mount Merritt, which was a big goal of mine for years. Made it later in the week, finally./ L/ path 
432/ Iceberg1.jpg/ Iceberg Lake/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Snapped from Shangri La, this is one of my favorite vantage points in all the park, and I picked a great afternoon for swirling light. Beware of bears if you visit this spot as there are no maintained trails and big animals love the hanging valley here./ L/ lake 
433/ IcebergLake2.jpg/ Iceberg Peak/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Iceberg Peak can be "walked" up from its backside, which I've done. But this snow coulour up the center has tempted me for years as a route for dual ice axes and crampons. I will go and accomplish it one year, but there are so many great places to visit in this country./ P/ flower 
434/ GNPShangriLaTrail.jpg/ Trail to Shangri La/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ This unofficial trail leads to a hidden lake in a hanging valley, which many combine with the Iceberg Lake Trail to make a wild loop through heavy bear country. Make noise. Watch your step. And enjoy!/ L/ path 
435/ TwoMedReflect1.jpg/ Two Medicine Reflection 1/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ A quaint wooden boat ride is relaxing and can shave miles off a hike into the mountains near Two Medicine lake. On this quiet morning hundreds of nearby campers rested and missed this sterling sunrise./ L/ lake, reflection 
436/ TwoMedReflect2.jpg/ Two Medicine Reflection 2/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Mount Sinopah is caught in early morning with thousands of campers slumbering away nearby. I had the lake to myself, which is a shame with views like this to share./ L/ reflection, lake 
437/ WAOlympicsSunsetPan.jpg/ Sunset Over the Olympics/ Olympic National Park, Washington/ A beautiful sunset over Mount Olympus and surroundings peaks above a field of wildflowers. This is taken near the Catwalk. A single group campsite is just feet from this point and is, in my humble opinion, the best place to spend a night in the Olympic Mountains. I suppose I have not tried sleeping quite everywhere yet though./ W/ flower, panorama, sunset , Pacific Northwest
438/ ArtistStormPan.jpg/ Artist Point Under Storms/ North Cascades, Washington/ Mount Shukskan is getting bombed with fresh storms from Artist Point, with sinister shadows at play. I still have not made it to the top of Mount Shuksan. The route is a little dangerous for solo climbers. I still intend to summit one day./ W/ storm, panorama , Pacific Northwest
439/ JohanFlowerPan.jpg/ Johannesburg High Noon/ North Cascades, Washington/ A wide shot of beautiful glaciated peaks behind meadows of flowers on a hike up Sahale Mountain, where I passed one of the best nights of my life at a very popular high glacier campground./ W/ panorama, flower , Pacific Northwest
440/ SahaleSunsetPeoplePan.jpg/ Watching the Sunset/ North Cascades, Washington/ A few fellow campers watch the amazing sunset in the right corner from the Sahale Glacier campground- popular for good reason. This panorama is a specialty size and to catch everything, including the folks in the corner, it must be printed at 12” X 48”, which can be done as a single long print or on 2 different 12” X 24” prints, then framed next to each other. I choose the latter for my own wall, placing them in joining corners. I will message you by email or phone about your preference before completing an order with this panorama./ W/ panorama, sunset, action, summit , Pacific Northwest
441/ AvalancheGorge1.jpg/ Avalanche Gorge/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ This is not quite the famous angle for snapping this beautiful and accessible gorge with a paved trail and wide bridges, but that adds to the charm of the picture, I think. Due to ease of access and proximity to the parking lot, this is one of the most photographed spots in all of the huge park./ P/ forest 
442/ HoleInWallPan.jpg/ Hole in the Wall Cirque/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ One of GNP's most beautiful trails leads up the flanks of this great cirque to the tip of Boulder Peak, high over cascading falls. The season is very short, though with crampons and ice axe, a party can have the area to themselves and go earlier in the summer./ W/ panorama, waterfall 
443/ LoganPan1.jpg/ Summit View from Mount Logan/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Remote Mount Logan, surprisingly distant from Logan Pass, and without trail to its summit, offers remarkable views in all directions for the hearty few who dare to venture out so far. This is among one of the best viewpoints in Montana I have come across./ W/ panorama, summit 
444/ TwoMedRefPan.jpg/ Two Medicine Lake at Morning/ Glacier National Park, Montana/ Two Medicine Lake, just feet from a popular campground, lies still in early morning light, with the Sinopah vintage wooden boat waiting for the day's duty by the docks. A few dollars gets you a ride across the lake and saves some footsteps. No small feat if you have many miles to travel./ W/ panorama, reflection, lake 
445/ SmilingBearText.jpg/ When You're Smiling/ Colorado Springs Zoo, Colorado/ An Asiatic Black Bear looks happy with a popular song lyric, often sung by Louis Armstrong, and others. This one makes a great card if you want a pre-written message./ L/ wildlife, text 
446/ ScoutFallsFoliage.jpg/ Aspen Grove Waterfall/ Wasatch Mountains, Utah/ On a hike up the Aspen Grove Trail in late autumn, I took a break near this waterfall getting the light just how I wanted, squatting among some wet ferns and foliage./ P/ waterfall, autumn
