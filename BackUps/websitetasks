Still to do with website:

Collect quotes (finish Wed night)
Create quote array and install onto every page as header

Javascript color picker for cards (need to test)

Javascript hide divs on About Page (need to test)

Search bar working without rupturing the entire search page

Use at media queries in my css to toggle between a left column and a top navigation; use a class for each and set display to 'none' based on screen size.
