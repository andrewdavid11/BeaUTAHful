Still to do with website:

Collect quotes
Create quote array and install onto every page as header

Javascript color picker for cards

Meta data for every page

Javascript hide divs on About Page

Search bar working without rupturing the entire search page

Use at media queries in my css to toggle between a left column and a top navigation; use a class for each and set display to 'none' based on screen size.
