	<h2>About Andrew and Hikephotos.com</h2>
		<p>My name is Andrew David, and HikePhotos.com is my site. All the code, layout, design, and maintanence are done in my spare time.
		Nature and wilderness photography provides a secondary income. All the photos on this site are for sale. Just click or tap a photo to see it larger.</p>
		<p>I work primarily in Web Design and Development, front and back-end coding, and am also a seasonal postal worker.
		I love to camp, hike, ski, climb, program, read, cook from scratch, and work on jigsaw puzzles while listening to classical music or old jazz. 
		I strive to stay busy and watch almost no television. Some movies are okay. Check out my blog for more about me.</p>
		<p>I market my photos under the brand name of Hikephotos.com, based primarily off the web. It is an easy to remember and find URL,
		and that name captures the heart of my product, I think. Hikephotos.com for now is just me, Andrew David. I may add some other artits in the future.</p>
		<p>I am available for hire by the right company, and yes, I take freelance work!</p>

		<p><a href="" target="_blank">View some Backend Coding Samples</a></p>
		<p>A freelance website will take 2-6 weeks, depending on the size, scope, and difficulty, and how quickly you get me all the images, copy, and information I need.
		I am light on experience, and I need to improve my portfolio, so I am working cheap for a limited time.</p>

    <h2>About This Site and My Web Development</h2>
        <p>This website is coded "from scratch" without a framework, just plain old scripts and code that instruct browsers and servers.</p>
        <p>The site is fully responsive, meaning it automatically adjusts to the screen size and device type of each visitor. Try viewing the site on different devices.
        Images change size, the navigation menu style and layout adjust to fit the screen, and the web experience is always simple and elegant.</p>
        <p>The shopping cart connects to both Stripe and Paypal, the two most popular payment solutions for small online businesses right now.
        A Wordpress Blog opens in a new window from within the main site menu, and is modeled to match the style of the main site. Opening the blog in a new window
        means a customer's shopping cart stays open and filled, and the navigation to purchasing pages is never out of sight, even if my blog captivates the customer while shopping.</p>
        <p>My special niche is creating e-commerce solutions, especially for other photographers. I can handle other types of websites with flair and aplomb as well,
        either fully customized, or within a popular framework such as Wordpress.</p>
        <div class="centerfloat redgreytear">
			<h3>My Core Skills for Website Design and Development</h3>
			  <p>HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, MySQL</p>
			  <p>Responsive Design</p>
			  <p>Database Design and Implementation</p>
			  <p>Fully customized secure e-Commerce</p>
			  <p>SSL, Stripe, Paypal</p>
			  <p>Wordpress, SmugMug, Git, Bootstrap and other frameworks</p>
        </div>
		<p>I will be adding login and upload pages in the near future to make it easy for me to build similar great sites quickly for other photographers. I will host those sites
		after creating a unique look and feel with similar structure to my own site, but tailored to your products, personality, and photography. I do everything behind the scenes, and all 
		a client needs to do is take photos, give them names, and upload them onto my shared server.</p>
		<p>Can't wait? Well <a href="contact.php">contact me</a>, and we can work out the details.</p>

    <h2>Guiding</h2>		
		<p>I am available for hire as a guide.
		Guiding is only by request. I do not actively seek clients, but I will try to accommodate all requests. After all, I hike a lot anyway.</p>
		<p>The more notice I get, the more likely I can arrange the time off!</p>
		<p>I reside in Utah but will arrange and lead a trip anywhere in the continental U.S. that I am familiar with, which includes most of the Rocky Mountain Range, and some of the Northern Cascades or Olympics.
		In general, my local base rates for 1 or 2 people will be: </p>
		<div class="centerfloat redgreytear">
			<ul>
				<li>$100 for a half day trip</li>
				<li>$150 for a full day trip</li>
				<li>$200 for an overnight trip</li>
				<li>$300 for a full weekend, including 2 nights outdoors</li>
				<li>$500 for a full week trip, up to 7 days and 6 nights</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>If the trip is outside Utah there will also be travel expenses.</p>
		<p>Group rates: there is an additional $10 charge per person per day (starting with the third person).</p>
		<p>I can assist you with mild climbing, and with your more cumbersome gear. I will provide a pack list.
		I will design the itinerary to hit spots at the best time of day for photographic light. It is no guarantee of great photographs, but your odds are better with me,
		as I will know the area, conditions, travel times required, and what other professionals need and desire.</p>
		<p>Some fresh, home-made, and healthy snacks and food are provided. I tell great stories, from my own trips and from the annals of famous mountain men.
		I also share my knowledge so you will be ready to head out into the wild on your own after a trip with me.
		Of course, if you want to keep hiring me, that's fine too.</p>
