	<h2>About Andrew, Sarah, and Hikephotos.com</h2>
		<p>My name is Andrew David, and HikePhotos.com is my site. All the code, layout, design, and maintanence are done in my spare time.
		Nature and wilderness photography provide a secondary income. All the photos on this site are for sale. Just click or tap a photo to see it larger.</p>
		<p>I work primarily in Web Design and Development, front and back-end coding, and am also a seasonal postal worker.
		I love to camp, hike, ski, climb, program, read, cook from scratch, and work on jigsaw puzzles.</p>
		<p>I am recently married to a wonderful young woman with many of the same interests.
		Her name is Sarah and she is definitely my better half. This site and company will take on more of her style and feel
		in the coming years as we build up our life together. Check out my blog for more about me. Sarah has a great food blog and is a real wizard!</p>
		<p>You can find us on Tumblr as well. Run a search for "ActiveGourmet" to follow us. We post some pics of food, recipes, and short 
		photo updates from our activities.</p>
		<p>Or check out my full adventure blog here on site. I will be adding an article or trip
		report each week, as life settles down and gets less busy for me.</p>
		<p>I am available for hire by the right company, and yes, I take freelance work!</p>

		<p><a href="http://codepen.io/andrewdavid11" target="_blank">Here are a few front-end projects while I build a second site for my full portfolio.</a></p>
		<p>A freelance website will take 2-6 weeks, depending on the size, scope, and difficulty, and how quickly you get me all the images, copy, and information I need.
		I am light on experience, and I need to improve my portfolio, so I am working cheap for a limited time.</p>

    <h2>About This Site and My Web Development</h2>
        <p>This website is coded "from scratch" without a framework, just plain old scripts and code that instruct browsers and servers.</p>
        <p>The site is fully responsive, meaning it automatically adjusts to the screen size and device type of each visitor. Try viewing the site on different devices.
        Images change size, the navigation menu style and layout adjust to fit the screen, and the web experience is always simple and elegant.</p>
        <p>The shopping cart connects to Stripe, and Paypal is on the way- the two most popular payment solutions for small online businesses right now.</p>
        <p>My special niche is creating e-commerce solutions, especially for other photographers. I can handle other types of websites with flair and aplomb as well,
        either fully customized, or within a popular framework such as Wordpress, SmugMug, or Magento.</p>
        <div class="centerfloat redgreytear">
			<h3>My Core Skills for Website Design and Development</h3>
			  <p>HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, MySQL</p>
			  <p>Responsive Design</p>
			  <p>Database Design and Implementation</p>
			  <p>Fully customized secure e-Commerce</p>
			  <p>SSL, Stripe, Paypal</p>
			  <p>Wordpress, SmugMug, Git, Bootstrap and other frameworks</p>
        </div>
		<p>I will be adding login and upload pages in the near future to make it easy for me to build similar great sites quickly for other photographers. I will host those sites
		after creating a unique look and feel with similar structure to my own site, but tailored to your products, personality, and photography. I do everything behind the scenes, and all 
		a client needs to do is take photos, give them names, and upload them onto my shared server.</p>
		<p>Can't wait? Well <a href="contact.php">contact me</a>, and we can work out the details.</p>

    <h2>Guiding</h2>		
		<p>My beautiful, intelligent wife and I available for hire as a guide team.
		Guiding is only by request. We do not actively seek clients, but will try to accommodate all requests.</p>
		<p>The more notice we get, the more likely we can arrange the time off!</p>
		<p>Sarah and I reside in Utah, so for now, we are only working this state.
		In general, our local base rates for 3 member groups or smaller: </p>
		<div class="centerfloat redgreytear">
			<ul>
				<li>$100 for a half day trip</li>
				<li>$150 for a full day trip</li>
				<li>$200 for an overnight trip</li>
				<li>$300 for a full weekend, including 2 nights outdoors</li>
				<li>Longer trips are not available right now.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Group rates: there is an additional $10 charge per person per day (starting with the third person).</p>
		<p>I can assist you with mild climbing, and with your more cumbersome gear. I will provide a pack list.
		I will design the itinerary to hit spots at the best time of day for photographic light. It is no guarantee of great photographs, but your odds are better with me,
		as I will know the area, conditions, travel times required, and what other professionals need and desire.</p>
		<p>Some fresh, home-made, and healthy snacks and food are provided and will include muffins, calzones, oat bars, cereal bars, and trail mix. 
		We tell great stories, from our own trips and from the annals of famous mountain men.
		We also share our knowledge so you will be ready to head out into the wild on your own for your next trip.
		Of course, if you want to keep hiring us, that's fine too. Taste our cooking and you just may have to!</p>
